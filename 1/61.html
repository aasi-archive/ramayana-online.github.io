                            Then Viśvámitra, when the Blest<br>Had sought their homes of heavenly rest,<br>Thus, mighty Prince, his counsel laid<br>Before the dwellers of the shade:<br>“The southern land where now we are<br>Offers this check our rites to bar:<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">“This cannot refer to the events just related: for Viśvámitra was
successful in the sacrifice performed for Triśanku. And yet no other
impediment is mentioned. Still his restless mind would not allow him
to remain longer in the same spot. So the character of Viśvámitra is
ingeniously and skilfully shadowed forth: as he had been formerly a
most warlike king, loving battle and glory, bold, active, sometimes
unjust, and more frequently magnanimous, such also he always shows
himself in his character of anchorite and ascetic.” SCHLEGEL.

The place is sacred still, and the
name is preserved in the Hindí. Lassen, however, says that this
Pushkala or Pushkara, called by the Grecian writers Πευκελίτις, the
earliest place of pilgrimage mentioned by name, is not to be
confounded with the modern Pushkara in Ajmere.

therefore separated by an immense space of time from Triśanku in
whose story Viśvámitra had played so important a part. Yet Richíka,
who is represented as having young sons while Ambarísha was yet
reigning being himself the son of Bhrigu and to be numbered with the
most ancient sages, is said to have married the younger sister of
Viśvámitra. But I need not again remark that there is a perpetual
anachronism in Indian mythology.” SCHLEGEL..

“In the mythical story related in this and the following Canto we
may discover, I think, some indication of the epoch at which the
immolation of lower animals was substituted for human sacrifice.… So
when Iphigenia was about to be sacrificed at Aulis, one legend tells
us that a hind was substituted for the virgin.” GORRESIO.

So the ram caught in the thicket took the place of Isaac, or, as the
Musalmáns say, of Ishmael.
