                            That night they slept and took their rest;<br>And then the mighty saint addressed,<br>With pleasant smile and accents mild<br>These words to Raghu’s princely child:<br>“Well pleased am I. High fate be thine,<br>Thou scion of a royal line.<br>Now will I, for I love thee so,<br>All heavenly arms on thee bestow.<br>Victor with these, whoe’er oppose,<br>Thy hand shall conquer all thy foes,<br>Though Gods and spirits of the air,<br>Serpents and fiends, the conflict dare.<br>I’ll give thee as a pledge of love<br>The mystic arms they use above,<br>For worthy thou to have revealed<br>The weapons I have learnt to wield.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">“The whole of this Canto together with the following one, regards
the belief, formerly prevalent in India, that by virtue of certain
spells, to be learnt and muttered, secret knowledge and superhuman
powers might be acquired. To this the poet has already alluded in
Canto xxiii. These incorporeal weapons are partly represented
according to the fashion of those ascribed to the Gods and the
different orders of demi-gods, partly are the mere creations of
fancy; and it would not be easy to say what idea the poet had of
them in his own mind, or what powers he meant to assign to each.”
