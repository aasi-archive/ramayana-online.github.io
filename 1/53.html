and teaching the Veda, oblations to the manes or spirits of the
departed, sacrifice to the Gods, hospitable offerings to men, and<em>&nbsp;a
gift of food to all creatures</em>. The last consisted of rice or other
grain which the Bráhman was to offer every day outside his house in
the open air. MANU, Book III. 70.” GORRESIO.

Indians. The<em>&nbsp;Śakas</em> are nomad tribes inhabiting Central Asia, the
Scythes of the Greeks, whom the Persians also, as Herodotus tells
us, called Sakæ just as the Indians did. Lib. VII 64 ὁι γὰρ Πέρσαι
πάντας τοὺς Σύθας. καλέουσι Σάκας. The name Yavans seems to be used
rather indefinitely for nations situated beyond Persia to the west.…
After the time of Alexander the Great the Indians as well as the
Persians called the Greeks also Yavans.” SCHLEGEL.

Lassen thinks that the Pahlavas were the same people as the Πάκτυες
of Herodotus, and that this non-Indian people dwelt on the
north-west confines of India.
