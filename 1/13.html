here. “Ágnishṭoma is the name of a sacrifice, or rather a series of
offerings to fire for five days. It is the first and principal part
of the Jyotishṭoma, one of the great sacrifices in which especially
the juice of the Soma plant is offered for the purpose of obtaining
Swarga or heaven.” GOLDSTÜCKER’S DICTIONARY. “The<em>&nbsp;Ágnishṭoma</em> is
Agni. It is called so because they (the gods) praised him with this
Stoma. They called it so to hide the proper meaning of the word: for
the gods like to hide the proper meaning of words.”

“On account of four classes of gods having praised Agni with four
Stomas, the whole was called<em>&nbsp;Chatushṭoma</em> (containing four
Stomas).”

“It (the Ágnishṭoma) is called<em>&nbsp;Jyotishṭoma</em>, for they praised Agni
when he had risen up (to the sky) in the shape of a light<em>&nbsp;jyotis</em>).”

“This (Ágnishṭoma) is a sacrificial performance which has no
beginning and no end.” HAUG’S<em>&nbsp;Aitareya Bráhmaṇam</em>.

The Atirátra, literally<em>&nbsp;lasting through the night</em>, is a division
of the service of the Jyotishṭoma.

The Abhijit,<em>&nbsp;the everywhere victorious</em>, is the name of a
sub-division of the great sacrifice of the Gavámanaya.

The Viśvajit, or<em>&nbsp;the all-conquering</em>, is a similar sub-division.

Áyus is the name of a service forming a division of the Abhiplava
sacrifice.

The<em>&nbsp;Aptoryám</em>, is the seventh or last part of the Jyotishṭoma, for
the performance of which it is not essentially necessary, but a
voluntary sacrifice instituted for the attainment of a specific
desire. The literal meaning of the word would be in conformity with
the<em>&nbsp;Prauḍhamanoramá</em>, “a sacrifice which procures the attainment of
the desired object.” GOLDSTÜCKER’S DICTIONARY.

“The<em>&nbsp;Ukthya</em> is a slight modification of the Ágnishṭoma sacrifice.
The noun to be supplied to it is<em>&nbsp;kratu</em>. It is a Soma sacrifice
also, and one of the seven Saṇsthas or component parts of the
Jyotishṭoma. Its name indicates its nature. For<em>&nbsp;Ukthya</em> means ‘what
refers to the Uktha,’ which is an older name for Shástra,<em>&nbsp;i.e.</em>
recitation of one of the Hotri priests at the time of the Soma
libations. Thus this sacrifice is only a kind of supplement to the
Ágnishṭoma.” HAUG.<em>&nbsp;Ai. B.</em>

</span></span><br>  The task was done, as laws prescribe:<br>The monarch, glory of his tribe,<br>Bestowed the land in liberal grants<br>Upon the sacred ministrants.<br>He gave the region of the east,<br>His conquest, to the Hotri priest.<br>The west, the celebrant obtained:<br>The south, the priest presiding gained:<br>The northern region was the share<br>Of him who chanted forth the prayer,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">“Four classes of priests were required in India at the most solemn
sacrifices. 1. The officiating priests, manual labourers, and
acolytes, who had chiefly to prepare the sacrificial ground, to
dress the altar, slay the victims, and pour out the libations. 2.
The choristers, who chant the sacred hymns. 3. The reciters or
readers, who repeat certain hymns. 4. The overseers or bishops, who
watch and superintend the proceedings of the other priests, and
ought to be familiar with all the Vedas. The formulas and verses to
be muttered by the first class are contained in the
Yajur-veda-sanhitá. The hymns to be sung by the second class are in
the Sama-veda-sanhitá. The Atharva-veda is said to be intended for
the Brahman or overseer, who is to watch the proceedings of the
sacrifice, and to remedy any mistake that may occur. The hymns to be
recited by the third class are contained in the Rigveda,”<em>&nbsp;Chips
from a German Workshop.</em>
