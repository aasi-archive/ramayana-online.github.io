deified oblation. This must have been the actual number at the
beginning of the Vedic religion gradually increased by successive
mythical and religious creations till the Indian Pantheon was
crowded with abstractions of every kind. Through the reverence with
which the words of the Veda were regarded, the immense host of
multiplied divinities, in later times, still bore the name of the
Thirty-three Gods.

in India, supported the earth with their enormous backs; when one of
these elephants shook his wearied head the earth trembled with its
woods and hills. An idea, or rather a mythical fancy, similar to
this, but reduced to proportions less grand, is found in Virgil when
he speaks of Enceladus buried under Ætna:”

“adi semiustum fulmine corpus
Urgeri mole hac, ingentemque insuper Ætnam
Impositam, ruptis flammam expirare caminis;

north-eastern direction; there the Devas did not sustain defeat.
This direction is<em>&nbsp;aparájitá</em>,<em>&nbsp;i.e.</em> unconquerable. Thence one
should do work in this direction, and have it done there; for such a
one (alone) is able to clear off his debts.” HAUG’S<em>&nbsp;Aitareya
Bráhmanam</em>, Vol. II, p. 33.

The debts here spoken of are a man’s religious obligations to the
Gods, the Pitaras or Manes, and men.

fiery force which suddenly unprisons itself and bursts forth in
volcanic effects. Kapil is, moreover, one of the names of Agni the
God of Fire.” GORRESIO.
