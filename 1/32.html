                            That conquering pair, of royal race,<br>Skilled to observe due time and place,<br>To Kuśik’s hermit son addressed,<br>In timely words, their meet request:<br>“When must we, lord, we pray thee tell,<br>Those Rovers of the Night repel?<br>Speak, lest we let the moment fly,<br>And pass the due occasion by.”<br>Thus longing for the strife, they prayed,<br>And thus the hermits answer made:<br>“Till the fifth day be come and past,<br>O Raghu’s sons, your watch must last.<br>The saint his Dikshá<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Certain ceremonies preliminary to a sacrifice.

</span></span> has begun,<br>And all that time will speak to none.”<br>Soon as the steadfast devotees<br>Had made reply in words like these,<br>The youths began, disdaining sleep,<br>Six days and nights their watch to keep.<br>The warrior pair who tamed the foe,<br>Unrivalled benders of the bow,<br>Kept watch and ward unwearied still<br>To guard the saint from scathe and ill.<br>’Twas now the sixth returning day,<br>The hour foretold had past away.<br>Then Ráma cried: “O Lakshmaṇ, now<br>Firm, watchful, resolute be thou.<br>The fiends as yet have kept afar<br>From the pure grove in which we are:<br>Yet waits us, ere the day shall close,<br>Dire battle with the demon foes.”<br><br>  While thus spoke Ráma borne away<br>By longing for the deadly fray,<br>See! bursting from the altar came<br>The sudden glory of the flame.<br>Round priest and deacon, and upon<br>Grass, ladles, flowers, the splendour shone,<br>  And the high rite, in order due,<br>With sacred texts began anew.<br>But then a loud and fearful roar<br>  Re-echoed through the sky;<br>And like vast clouds that shadow o’er<br>  The heavens in dark July,<br>Involved in gloom of magic might<br>  Two fiends rushed on amain,<br>Márícha, Rover of the Night,<br>  Suváhu, and their train.<br>As on they came in wild career<br>  Thick blood in rain they shed;<br>And Ráma saw those things of fear<br>  Impending overhead.<br>Then soon as those accursed two<br>  Who showered down blood be spied,<br>Thus to his brother brave and true<br>  Spoke Ráma lotus-eyed:<br>“Now, Lakshmaṇ, thou these fiends shalt see,<br>  Man-eaters, foul of mind,<br>Before my mortal weapon flee<br>  Like clouds before the wind.”<br>He spoke. An arrow, swift as thought,<br>  Upon his bow he pressed,<br>And smote, to utmost fury wrought,<br>  Márícha on the breast.<br>Deep in his flesh the weapon lay<br>  Winged by the mystic spell,<br>And, hurled a hundred leagues away,<br>  In ocean’s flood he fell.<br>Then Ráma, when he saw the foe<br>  Convulsed and mad with pain<br>Neath the chill-pointed weapon’s blow,<br>  To Lakshmaṇ spoke again:<br>“See, Lakshmaṇ, see! this mortal dart<br>  That strikes a numbing chill,<br>Hath struck him senseless with the smart,<br>  But left him breathing still.<br>But these who love the evil way,<br>  And drink the blood they spill,<br>Rejoicing holy rites to stay,<br>  Fierce plagues, my hand shall kill.”<br>He seized another shaft, the best,<br>  Aglow with living flame;<br>It struck Suváhu on the chest,<br>  And dead to earth he came.<br>Again a dart, the Wind-God’s own,<br>  Upon his string he laid,<br>And all the demons were o’erthrown,<br>  The saints no more afraid.<br>When thus the fiends were slain in fight,<br>Disturbers of each holy rite,<br>Due honour by the saints was paid<br>To Ráma for his wondrous aid:<br>So Indra is adored when he<br>Has won some glorious victory.<br>Success at last the rite had crowned,<br>And Viśvámitra gazed around,<br>And seeing every side at rest,<br>The son of Raghu thus addressed:<br>“My joy, O Prince, is now complete:<br>  Thou hast obeyed my will:<br>Perfect before, this calm retreat<br>  Is now more perfect still.”
