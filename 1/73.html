                            On that same day that saw the king<br>His gift of kine distributing,<br>The lord of Kekaya’s son, by name<br>Yudhájit, Bharat’s uncle, came,<br>Asked of the monarch’s health, and then<br>Addressed the reverend king of men:<br>“The lord of Kekaya’s realm by me<br>Sends greeting, noble King, to thee:<br>Asks if the friends thy prayers would bless<br>Uninterrupted health possess.<br>Right anxious, mighty King, is he<br>My sister’s princely boy to see.<br>For this I sought Ayodhyá fair<br>The message of my sire to bear.<br>There learning, O my liege, that thou<br>With sons and noble kinsmen now<br>Wast resting here, I sought the place<br>Longing to see my nephew’s face.”<br>The king with kind observance cheered<br>His friend by tender ties endeared,<br>And every choicest honour pressed<br>Upon his honourable guest.<br><br>  That night with all his children spent,<br>At morn King Daśaratha went,<br>Behind Vaśishṭha and the rest,<br>To the fair ground for rites addressed.<br>Then when the lucky hour was nigh<br>Called Victory, of omen high,<br>Came Ráma, after vow and prayer<br>For nuptial bliss and fortune fair,<br>With the three youths in bright attire,<br>And stood beside his royal sire.<br>To Janak then Vaśishṭha sped,<br>And to Videha’s monarch said:<br>“O King, Ayodhyá’s ruler now<br>Has breathed the prayer and vowed the vow,<br>And with his sons expecting stands<br>The giver of the maidens’ hands.<br>The giver and the taker both<br>Must ratify a mutual oath.<br>Perform the part for which we wait,<br>And rites of marriage celebrate.”<br><br>  Skilled in the laws which Scriptures teach,<br>He answered thus Vaśishṭha’s speech:<br>“O Saint, what warder bars the gate?<br>Whose bidding can the king await?<br>In one’s own house what doubt is shown?<br>This kingdom, Sage, is all thine own.<br>E’en now the maidens may be found<br>Within the sacrificial ground:<br>Each vow is vowed and prayed each prayer,<br>And they, like fire, are shining there.<br>Here by the shrine my place I took<br>Expecting thee with eager look,<br>No bar the nuptial rites should stay:<br>What cause have we for more delay?”<br>When Janak’s speech the monarch heard,<br>To sons and saints he gave the word,<br>And set them in the holy ring,<br>Then to Vaśishṭha spoke the king<br>Of Mithilá: “O mighty Sage,<br>Now let this task thy care engage,<br>And lend thine aid and counsel wise<br>The nuptial rites to solemnize.”<br><br>  The saint Vaśishṭha gave assent,<br>And quickly to the task he went,<br>With Viśvámitra, nothing loth,<br>And Śatánanda aiding both.<br>Then, as the rules prescribe, they made<br>An altar in the midst, and laid<br>Fresh wreaths of fragrant flowers thereon.<br>The golden ladles round it shone;<br>And many a vase, which branches hid<br>Fixed in the perforated lid,<br>And sprays, and cups, and censers there<br>Stood filled with incense rich and rare;<br>Shell-bowls, and spoons, and salvers dressed<br>With gifts that greet the honoured guest;<br>Piles of parched rice some dishes bore,<br>Others with corn prepared ran o’er;<br>And holy grass was duly spread<br>In equal lengths, while prayers were said.<br>Next chief of saints, Vaśishṭha came<br>And laid the offering in the flame.<br>Then by the hand King Janak drew<br>His Sítá, beautiful to view,<br>And placed her, bright in rich attire,<br>Ráma to face, before the fire,<br>Thus speaking to the royal boy<br>Who filled Kauśalyá’s heart with joy:<br>“Here Sítá stands, my daughter fair,<br>The duties of thy life to share.<br>Take from her father, take thy bride;<br>Join hand to hand, and bliss betide!<br>A faithful wife, most blest is she,<br>And as thy shade will follow thee.”<br><br>  Thus as he spoke the monarch threw<br>O’er her young limbs the holy dew,<br>While Gods and saints were heard to swell<br>The joyous cry, ’Tis well! ’Tis well!<br>His daughter Sítá thus bestowed,<br>O’er whom the sacred drops had flowed.<br>King Janak’s heart with rapture glowed.<br>Then to Prince Lakshmaṇ thus he cried:<br>“Take Urmilá thine offered bride,<br>And clasp her hand within thine own<br>Ere yet the lucky hour be flown.”<br>Then to Prince Bharat thus cried he;<br>“Come, take the hand of Mándavi.”<br>Then to Śatrughna: “In thy grasp<br>The hand of Srutakírti clasp.<br>Now, Raghu’s sons, may all of you<br>Be gentle to your wives and true;<br>Keep well the vows you make to-day,<br>Nor let occasion slip away.”<br><br>  King Janak’s word the youths obeyed;<br>The maidens’ hands in theirs they laid.<br>Then with their brides the princes went<br>With ordered steps and reverent<br>Round both the fire and Janak, round<br>The sages and the sacred ground.<br><br>  A flowery flood of lucid dyes<br>In rain descended from the skies,<br>While with celestial voices blent<br>Sweet strains from many an instrument,<br>And the nymphs danced in joyous throng<br>Responsive to the minstrel’s song.<br>Such signs of exultation they<br>Saw on the princes’ wedding day.<br>Still rang the heavenly music’s sound<br>When Raghu’s sons thrice circled round<br>The fire, each one with reverent head,<br>And homeward then their brides they led.<br>They to the sumptuous palace hied<br>That Janak’s care had seen supplied.<br>The monarch girt with saint and peer<br>Still fondly gazing followed near.
