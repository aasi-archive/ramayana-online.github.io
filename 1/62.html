                            As thus the king that youth conveyed,<br>His weary steeds at length he stayed<br>At height of noon their rest to take<br>Upon the bank of Pushkar’s lake.<br>There while the king enjoyed repose<br>The captive Śunahśepha rose,<br>And hasting to the water’s side<br>His uncle Viśvámitra spied,<br>With many a hermit ’neath the trees<br>Engaged in stern austerities.<br><br>  Distracted with the toil and thirst,<br>With woeful mien, away he burst,<br>Swift to the hermit’s breast he flew,<br>And weeping thus began to sue:<br>“No sire have I, no mother dear,<br>No kith or kin my heart to cheer:<br>As justice bids, O Hermit, deign<br>To save me from the threatened pain.<br>O thou to whom the wretched flee,<br>And find a saviour, Saint, in thee,<br>Now let the king obtain his will,<br>And me my length of days fulfil,<br>That rites austere I too may share,<br>May rise to heaven and rest me there.<br>With tender soul and gentle brow<br>Be guardian of the orphan thou,<br>And as a father pities, so<br>Preserve me from my fear and woe.”<br><br>  When Viśvámitra, glorious saint,<br>Had heard the boy’s heart-rending plaint.<br>He soothed his grief, his tears he dried,<br>Then called his sons to him, and cried:<br>“The time is come for you to show<br>The duty and the aid bestow<br>For which, regarding future life,<br>A man gives children to his wife.<br>This hermit’s son, whom here you see<br>A suppliant, refuge seeks with me.<br>O sons, the friendless youth befriend,<br>And, pleasing me, his life defend.<br>For holy works you all have wrought,<br>True to the virtuous life I taught.<br>Go, and as victims doomed to bleed,<br>Die, and Lord Agni’s hunger feed.<br>So shall the rite completed end,<br>This orphan gain a saving friend,<br>Due offerings to the Gods be paid,<br>And your own father’s voice obeyed.”<br><br>  Then Madhushyand and all the rest<br>Answered their sire with scorn and jest:<br>“What! aid to others’ sons afford,<br>And leave thine own to die, my lord!<br>To us it seems a horrid deed,<br>As ’twere on one’s own flesh to feed.”<br><br>  The hermit heard his sons’ reply,<br>And burning rage inflamed his eye.<br>Then forth his words of fury burst:<br>“Audacious speech, by virtue cursed!<br>It lifts on end each shuddering hair—<br>My charge to scorn! my wrath to dare!<br>You, like Vaśishṭha’s evil brood,<br>Shall make the flesh of dogs your food<br>A thousand years in many a birth,<br>And punished thus shall dwell on earth.”<br><br>  Thus on his sons his curse he laid.<br>Then calmed again that youth dismayed,<br>And blessed him with his saving aid:<br>“When in the sacred fetters bound,<br>And with a purple garland crowned,<br>At Vishṇu’s post thou standest tied,<br>With lauds be Agni glorified.<br>And these two hymns of holy praise<br>Forget not, Hermit’s son, to raise<br>In the king’s rite, and thou shalt be<br>Lord of thy wish, preserved, and free.”<br><br>  He learnt the hymns with mind intent,<br>And from the hermit’s presence went.<br>To Ambarísha thus he spake:<br>“Let us our onward journey take.<br>Haste to thy home, O King, nor stay<br>The lustral rites with slow delay.”<br><br>  The boy’s address the monarch cheered,<br>And soon the sacred ground he neared.<br>The convocation’s high decree<br>Declared the youth from blemish free;<br>Clothed in red raiment he was tied<br>A victim at the pillar’s side.<br>There bound, the Fire-God’s hymn he raised,<br>And Indra and Upendra praised.<br>Thousand-eyed Vishṇu, pleased to hear<br>The mystic laud, inclined his ear,<br>And won by worship, swift to save,<br>Long life to Śunahśepha gave.<br>The king in bounteous measure gained<br>The fruit of sacrifice ordained,<br>By grace of Him who rules the skies,<br>Lord Indra of the thousand eyes.<br><br>  And Viśvámitra evermore.<br>Pursued his task on Pushkar’s shore<br>Until a thousand years had past<br>In fierce austerity and fast.
