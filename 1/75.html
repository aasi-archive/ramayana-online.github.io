to the south of the mouths of the Ganges was the seat of this
people. Hence it may be suspected that this Mahendra is what Pliny
calls ‘promontorium Calingon.’ The modern name,<em>&nbsp;Cape Palmyras</em>,
from the palmyras Borassus flabelliformis, which abound there agrees
remarkably with the description of the poet who speaks of the groves
of these trees.<em>&nbsp;Raghuvaṅśa</em>, VI. 51.” SCHLEGEL.
