should be remembered that the monkeys of an Indian forest, the
“bough-deer” as the poets call them, are very different animals from
the “turpissima bestia” that accompanies the itinerant organ-grinder
or grins in the Zoological Gardens of London. Milton has made his
hero, Satan, assume the forms of a cormorant, a toad, and a serpent,
and I cannot see that this creation of semi-divine Vánars, or
monkeys, is more ridiculous or undignified.
