Kuśáśva, and his city Kauśáśví. This name does not occur elsewhere.
The reading of the northern recension is confirmed by Foê Kouê Ki;
p. 385, where the city<em>&nbsp;Kiaoshangmi</em> is mentioned. It lay 500<em>&nbsp;lis</em>
to the south-west of<em>&nbsp;Prayága</em>, on the south bank of the Jumna.<em>&nbsp;Mahodaya</em> is another name of Kanyakubja:<em>&nbsp;Dharmáraṇya</em>, the wood to
which the God of Justice is said to have fled through fear of Soma
the Moon-God was in Magadh. Girivraja was in the same neighbourhood.
