of whom frequent mention is made in the Vedas and the Indian myths.
The Aśvins have much in common with the Dioscuri of Greece, and
their mythical genealogy seems to indicate that their origin was
astronomical. They were, perhaps, at first the morning star and
evening star. They are said to be the children of the sun and the
nymph Aśviní, who is one of the lunar asterisms personified. In the
popular mythology they are regarded as the physicians of the Gods.”
