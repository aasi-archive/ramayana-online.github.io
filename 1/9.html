</span></span> cry<br>  With music filled the place<br>As ’twere some city in the sky<br>Which heavenly minstrels grace.<br>With each voluptuous art they strove<br>To win the tenant of the grove,<br>And with their graceful forms inspire<br>His modest soul with soft desire.<br>With arch of brow, with beck and smile,<br>With every passion-waking wile<br>Of glance and lotus hand,<br>With all enticements that excite<br>The longing for unknown delight<br>  Which boys in vain withstand.<br>Forth came the hermit’s son to view<br>The wondrous sight to him so new,<br>  And gazed in rapt surprise,<br>For from his natal hour till then<br>On woman or the sons of men<br>  He ne’er had cast his eyes.<br>He saw them with their waists so slim,<br>With fairest shape and faultless limb,<br>In variegated robes arrayed,<br>And sweetly singing as they played.<br>Near and more near the hermit drew,<br>  And watched them at their game,<br>And stronger still the impulse grew<br>  To question whence they came.<br>They marked the young ascetic gaze<br>With curious eye and wild amaze,<br>And sweet the long-eyed damsels sang,<br>And shrill their merry laughter rang.<br>Then came they nearer to his side,<br>And languishing with passion cried:<br>“Whose son, O youth, and who art thou,<br>Come suddenly to join us now?<br>And why dost thou all lonely dwell<br>In the wild wood? We pray thee, tell,<br>We wish to know thee, gentle youth;<br>Come, tell us, if thou wilt, the truth.”<br>  He gazed upon that sight he ne’er<br>Had seen before, of girls so fair,<br>And out of love a longing rose<br>His sire and lineage to disclose:<br>“My father,” thus he made reply,<br>“Is Kaśyap’s son, a saint most high,<br>Vibháṇdak styled; from him I came,<br>And Rishyaśring he calls my name.<br>Our hermit cot is near this place:<br>Come thither, O ye fair of face;<br>There be it mine, with honour due,<br>Ye gentle youths, to welcome you.”<br>  They heard his speech, and gave consent,<br>And gladly to his cottage went.<br>Vibháṇdak’s son received them well<br>Beneath the shelter of his cell<br>With guest-gift, water for their feet,<br>And woodland fruit and roots to eat,<br>They smiled, and spoke sweet words like these,<br>Delighted with his courtesies:<br>“We too have goodly fruit in store,<br>Grown on the trees that shade our door;<br>Come, if thou wilt, kind Hermit, haste<br>The produce of our grove to taste;<br>And let, O good Ascetic, first<br>This holy water quench thy thirst.”<br>They spoke, and gave him comfits sweet<br>Prepared ripe fruits to counterfeit;<br>And many a dainty cate beside<br>And luscious mead their stores supplied.<br>The seeming fruits, in taste and look,<br>The unsuspecting hermit took,<br>For, strange to him, their form beguiled<br>The dweller in the lonely wild.<br>Then round his neck fair arms were flung,<br>And there the laughing damsels clung,<br>And pressing nearer and more near<br>With sweet lips whispered at his ear;<br>While rounded limb and swelling breast<br>The youthful hermit softly pressed.<br>The pleasing charm of that strange bowl,<br>  The touch of a tender limb,<br>Over his yielding spirit stole<br>  And sweetly vanquished him.<br>But vows, they said, must now be paid;<br>  They bade the boy farewell,<br>And, of the aged saint afraid,<br>  Prepared to leave the dell.<br>With ready guile they told him where<br>  Their hermit dwelling lay:<br>Then, lest the sire should find them there,<br>  Sped by wild paths away.<br>They fled and left him there alone<br>  By longing love possessed;<br>And with a heart no more his own<br>  He roamed about distressed.<br>The aged saint came home, to find<br>  The hermit boy distraught,<br>Revolving in his troubled mind<br>  One solitary thought.<br>“Why dost thou not, my son,” he cried,<br>  “Thy due obeisance pay?<br>Why do I see thee in the tide<br>  Of whelming thought to-day?<br>A devotee should never wear<br>  A mien so sad and strange.<br>Come, quickly, dearest child, declare<br>  The reason of the change.”<br>And Rishyaśring, when questioned thus,<br>  Made answer in this wise:<br>“O sire, there came to visit us<br>  Some men with lovely eyes.<br>About my neck soft arms they wound<br>  And kept me tightly held<br>To tender breasts so soft and round,<br>  That strangely heaved and swelled.<br>They sing more sweetly as they dance<br>  Than e’er I heard till now,<br>And play with many a sidelong glance<br>  And arching of the brow.”<br>“My son,” said he, “thus giants roam<br>  Where holy hermits are,<br>And wander round their peaceful home<br>  Their rites austere to mar.<br>I charge thee, thou must never lay<br>  Thy trust in them, dear boy:<br>They seek thee only to betray,<br>  And woo but to destroy.”<br>Thus having warned him of his foes<br>  That night at home he spent.<br>And when the morrow’s sun arose<br>Forth to the forest went.<br>  But Rishyaśring with eager pace<br>Sped forth and hurried to the place<br>Where he those visitants had seen<br>Of daintly waist and charming mien.<br>When from afar they saw the son<br>Of Saint Vibháṇdak toward them run,<br>To meet the hermit boy they hied,<br>And hailed him with a smile, and cried:<br>“O come, we pray, dear lord, behold<br>Our lovely home of which we told<br>Due honour there to thee we’ll pay,<br>And speed thee on thy homeward way.”<br>Pleased with the gracious words they said<br>He followed where the damsels led.<br>As with his guides his steps he bent,<br>  That Bráhman high of worth,<br>A flood of rain from heaven was sent<br>  That gladdened all the earth.<br><br>  Vibháṇdak took his homeward road,<br>And wearied by the heavy load<br>Of roots and woodland fruit he bore<br>Entered at last his cottage door.<br>Fain for his son he looked around,<br>But desolate the cell he found.<br>He stayed not then to bathe his feet,<br>Though fainting with the toil and heat,<br>But hurried forth and roamed about<br>Calling the boy with cry and shout,<br>He searched the wood, but all in vain;<br>Nor tidings of his son could gain.<br><br>  One day beyond the forest’s bound<br>The wandering saint a village found,<br>And asked the swains and neatherds there<br>Who owned the land so rich and fair,<br>With all the hamlets of the plain,<br>And herds of kine and fields of grain.<br>They listened to the hermit’s words,<br>And all the guardians of the herds,<br>With suppliant hands together pressed,<br>This answer to the saint addressed:<br>“The Angas’ lord who bears the name<br>Of Lomapád, renowned by fame,<br>Bestowed these hamlets with their kine<br>And all their riches, as a sign<br>Of grace, on Rishyaśring: and he<br>Vibháṇdak’s son is said to be.”<br>The hermit with exulting breast<br>The mighty will of fate confessed,<br>By meditation’s eye discerned;<br>And cheerful to his home returned.<br><br>  A stately ship, at early morn,<br>The hermit’s son away had borne.<br>Loud roared the clouds, as on he sped,<br>The sky grew blacker overhead;<br>Till, as he reached the royal town,<br>A mighty flood of rain came down.<br>By the great rain the monarch’s mind<br>The coming of his guest divined.<br>To meet the honoured youth he went,<br>And low to earth his head he bent.<br>With his own priest to lead the train,<br>He gave the gift high guests obtain.<br>And sought, with all who dwelt within<br>The city walls, his grace to win.<br>He fed him with the daintiest fare,<br>He served him with unceasing care,<br>And ministered with anxious eyes<br>Lest anger in his breast should rise;<br>And gave to be the Bráhman’s bride<br>His own fair daughter, lotus-eyed.<br><br>  Thus loved and honoured by the king,<br>The glorious Bráhman Rishyaśring<br>Passed in that royal town his life<br>With Śántá his beloved wife.”
