XXXV, and whom the poet brings yet alive upon the scene in Canto
LXI. Her proper name was<em>&nbsp;Satyavatí</em> (Truthful); the patronymic,
Kauśikí was preserved by the river into which she is said to have
been changed, and is still recognized in the corrupted forms Kuśa
and Kuśí. The river flows from the heights of the Himálaya towards
the Ganges, bounding on the east the country of Videha (Behar). The
name is no doubt half hidden in the<em>&nbsp;Cosoagus</em> of Pliny and the<em>&nbsp;Kossounos</em> of Arrian. But each author has fallen into the same
error in his enumeration of these rivers (Condochatem, Erannoboam,
Cosoagum, Sonum). The Erannoboas, (Hiraṇyaváha) and the Sone are not
different streams, but well-known names of the same river. Moreover
the order is disturbed, in which on the right and left they fall
into the Ganges. To be consistent with geography it should be
written: Erannoboam sive Sonum, Condochatem (Gandakí), Cosoagum.”
