                            But Diti, when her sons were slain,<br>Wild with a childless mother’s pain,<br>To Kaśyap spake, Marícha’s son,<br>Her husband: “O thou glorious one!<br>Dead are the children, mine no more,<br>The mighty sons to thee I bore.<br>Long fervour’s meed, I crave a boy<br>Whose arm may Indra’s life destroy.<br>The toil and pain my care shall be:<br>To bless my hope depends on thee.<br>Give me a mighty son to slay<br>Fierce Indra, gracious lord! I pray.”<br><br>  Then glorious Kaśyap thus replied<br>To Diti, as she wept and sighed:<br>“Thy prayer is heard, dear saint! Remain<br>Pure from all spot, and thou shalt gain<br>A son whose arm shall take the life<br>Of Indra in the battle strife.<br>For full a thousand years endure<br>Free from all stain, supremely pure;<br>Then shall thy son and mine appear,<br>Whom the three worlds shall serve with fear.”<br>These words the glorious Kaśyap said,<br>Then gently stroked his consort’s head,<br>Blessed her, and bade a kind adieu,<br>And turned him to his rites anew.<br>Soon as her lord had left her side,<br>Her bosom swelled with joy and pride.<br>She sought the shade of holy boughs,<br>And there began her awful vows.<br>While yet she wrought her rites austere,<br>Indra, unbidden, hastened near,<br>With sweet observance tending her,<br>A reverential minister.<br>Wood, water, fire, and grass he brought,<br>Sweet roots and woodland fruit he sought,<br>And all her wants, the Thousand-eyed,<br>With never-failing care, supplied,<br>With tender love and soft caress<br>Removing pain and weariness.<br><br>  When, of the thousand years ordained,<br>Ten only unfulfilled remained,<br>Thus to her son, the Thousand-eyed,<br>The Goddess in her triumph cried:<br>“Best of the mighty! there remain<br>But ten short years of toil and pain;<br>These years of penance soon will flee,<br>And a new brother thou shalt see.<br>Him for thy sake I’ll nobly breed,<br>And lust of war his soul shall feed;<br>Then free from care and sorrow thou<br>Shalt see the worlds before him bow.”<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">“In this myth of Indra destroying the unborn fruit of Diti with his
thunderbolt, from which afterwards came the Maruts or Gods of Wind
and Storm, geological phenomena are, it seems, represented under
mythical images. In the great Mother of the Gods is, perhaps,
figured the dry earth: Indra the God of thunder rends it open, and
there issue from its rent bosom the Maruts or exhalations of the
earth. But such ancient myths are difficult to interpret with
absolute certainty.” GORRESIO.
