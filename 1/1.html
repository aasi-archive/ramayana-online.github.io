believed that character and fortune could be foretold not from the
face only but from marks upon the neck and hands. Three lines under
the chin like those at the mouth of a conch<em>&nbsp;Śańkha</em>) were regarded
as a peculiarly auspicious sign indicating, as did also the mark of
Vishṇu’s discus on the hand, one born to be a<em>&nbsp;chakravartin</em> or
universal emperor. In the palmistry of Europe the line of fortune,
as well as the line of life, is in the hand. Cardan says that marks
on the nails and teeth also show what is to happen to us: “Sunt
etiam in nobis vestigia quædam futurorum eventuum in unguibus atque
etiam in dentibus.” Though the palmy days of Indian chiromancy have
passed away, the art is still to some extent studied and believed
in.

by the Bráhmans not to one work, but to the whole body of their most
ancient sacred literature. Veda is the same word which appears in
the Greek οίδα, I know, and in the English wise, wisdom, to wit. The
name of Veda is commonly given to four collections of hymns, which
are respectively known by the names of Rig-veda, Yajur-veda,
Sáma-veda, and Atharva-veda.”

“As the language of the Veda, the Sanskrit, is the most ancient type
of the English of the present day, (Sanskrit and English are but
varieties of one and the same language,) so its thoughts and
feelings contain in reality the first roots and germs of that
intellectual growth which by an unbroken chain connects our own
generation with the ancestors of the Aryan race,—with those very
people who at the rising and setting of the sun listened with
trembling hearts to the songs of the Veda, that told them of bright
powers above, and of a life to come after the sun of their own lives
had set in the clouds of the evening. These men were the true
ancestors of our race, and the Veda is the oldest book we have in
which to study the first beginnings of our language, and of all that
is embodied in language. We are by nature Aryan, Indo-European, not
Semitic: our spiritual kith and kin are to be found in India,
Persia, Greece, Italy, Germany: not in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or
Palestine.”

Daksha repeatedly interposed, till, finding his remonstrances vain,
he denounced a curse upon his son-in-law, in consequence of which he
remained childless and became affected by consumption. The wives of
Chandra having interceded in his behalf with their father, Daksha
modified an imprecation which he could not recall, and pronounced

should alternate with periods of recovery. Hence the successive wane
