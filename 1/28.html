                            Thus spoke the saint. Each vigorous word<br>The noble monarch’s offspring heard,<br>And, reverent hands together laid,<br>His answer to the hermit made:<br>“My sire and mother bade me aye<br>Thy word, O mighty Saint, obey<br>So will I, O most glorious, kill<br>This Táḍaká who joys in ill,<br>For such my sire’s, and such thy will.<br>To aid with mine avenging hand<br>The Bráhmans, kine, and all the land,<br>Obedient, heart and soul, I stand.”<br><br>  Thus spoke the tamer of the foe,<br>And by the middle grasped his bow.<br>Strongly he drew the sounding string<br>That made the distant welkin ring.<br>Scared by the mighty clang the deer<br>That roamed the forest shook with fear,<br>And Táḍaká the echo heard,<br>And rose in haste from slumber stirred.<br>In wild amaze, her soul aflame<br>With fury toward the spot she came.<br>When that foul shape of evil mien<br>And stature vast as e’er was seen<br>The wrathful son of Raghu eyed,<br>He thus unto his brother cried:<br>“Her dreadful shape, O Lakshmaṇ, see,<br>A form to shudder at and flee.<br>The hideous monster’s very view<br>Would cleave a timid heart in two.<br>Behold the demon hard to smite,<br>Defended by her magic might.<br>My hand shall stay her course to-day,<br>And shear her nose and ears away.<br>No heart have I her life to take:<br>I spare it for her sex’s sake.<br>My will is but, with minished force,<br>To check her in her evil course.”<br>While thus he spoke, by rage impelled<br>  Roaring as she came nigh,<br>The fiend her course at Ráma held<br>  With huge arms tossed on high.<br>Her, rushing on, the seer assailed<br>  With a loud cry of hate;<br>And thus the sons of Raghu hailed:<br>  “Fight, and be fortunate.”<br>Then from the earth a horrid cloud<br>  Of dust the demon raised,<br>And for awhile in darkling shroud<br>  Wrapt Raghu’s sons amazed.<br>Then calling on her magic power<br>  The fearful fight to wage,<br>She smote him with a stony shower,<br>  Till Ráma burned with rage.<br>Then pouring forth his arrowy rain<br>  That stony flood to stay,<br>With winged darts, as she charged amain,<br>  He shore her hands away.<br>As Táḍaká still thundered near<br>  Thus maimed by Ráma’s blows,<br>Lakshmaṇ in fury severed sheer<br>  The monster’s ears and nose.<br>Assuming by her magic skill<br>  A fresh and fresh disguise,<br>She tried a thousand shapes at will,<br>  Then vanished from their eyes.<br>When Gádhi’s son of high renown<br>Still saw the stony rain pour down<br>Upon each princely warrior’s head,<br>With words of wisdom thus he said:<br>“Enough of mercy, Ráma, lest<br>This sinful evil-working pest,<br>Disturber of each holy rite,<br>Repair by magic arts her might.<br>Without delay the fiend should die,<br>For, see, the twilight hour is nigh.<br>And at the joints of night and day<br>Such giant foes are hard to slay.”<br>Then Ráma, skilful to direct<br>  His arrow to the sound,<br>With shafts the mighty demon checked<br>  Who rained her stones around.<br>She sore impeded and beset<br>By Ráma and his arrowy net,<br>Though skilled in guile and magic lore,<br>Rushed on the brothers with a roar.<br>Deformed, terrific, murderous, dread,<br>Swift as the levin on she sped,<br>Like cloudy pile in autumn’s sky,<br>Lifting her two vast arms on high,<br>When Ráma smote her with a dart,<br>Shaped like a crescent, to the heart.<br>Sore wounded by the shaft that came<br>With lightning speed and surest aim,<br>Blood spouting from her mouth and side,<br>She fell upon the earth and died.<br>Soon as the Lord who rules the sky<br>Saw the dread monster lifeless lie,<br>He called aloud, Well done! well done!<br>And the Gods honoured Raghu’s son.<br>Standing in heaven the Thousand-eyed,<br>With all the Immortals, joying cried:<br>“Lift up thine eyes, O Saint, and see<br>The Gods and Indra nigh to thee.<br>This deed of Ráma’s boundless might<br>Has filled our bosoms with delight,<br>Now, for our will would have it so,<br>To Raghu’s son some favour show.<br>Invest him with the power which naught<br>But penance gains and holy thought,<br>Those heavenly arms on him bestow<br>To thee entrusted long ago<br>By great Kriśáśva best of kings,<br>Son of the Lord of living things.<br>More fit recipient none can be<br>Than he who joys it following thee;<br>And for our sakes the monarch’s seed<br>Has yet to do a mighty deed.”<br><br>  He spoke; and all the heavenly train<br>Rejoicing sought their homes again,<br>While honour to the saint they paid.<br>Then came the evening’s twilight shade,<br>The best of hermits overjoyed<br>To know the monstrous fiend destroyed,<br>His lips on Ráma’s forehead pressed,<br>And thus the conquering chief addressed:<br>“O Ráma gracious to the sight.<br>Here will we pass the present night,<br>And with the morrow’s earliest ray<br>Bend to my hermitage our way.”<br>The son of Daśaratha heard,<br>Delighted, Viśvámitra’s word,<br>And as he bade, that night he spent<br>In Táḍaká’s wild wood, content.<br>And the grove shone that happy day,<br>Freed from the curse that on it lay,<br>Like Chaitraratha<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The famous pleasure-garden of Kuvera the God of Wealth.
