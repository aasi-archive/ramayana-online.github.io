                            Right glad was Viśvámitra when<br>He saw the prince of saintly men.<br>Low at his feet the hero bent,<br>And did obeisance, reverent.<br><br>  The king was welcomed in, and shown<br>A seat beside the hermit’s own,<br>Who offered him, when resting there,<br>Fruit in due course, and woodland fare.<br>And Viśvámitra, noblest king,<br>Received Vaśishṭha’s welcoming,<br>Turned to his host, and prayed him tell<br>That he and all with him were well.<br>Vaśishṭha to the king replied<br>That all was well on every side,<br>That fire, and vows, and pupils throve,<br>And all the trees within the grove.<br>And then the son of Brahmá, best<br>Of all who pray with voice suppressed,<br>Questioned with pleasant words like these<br>The mighty king who sate at ease:<br>“And is it well with thee? I pray;<br>And dost thou win by virtuous sway<br>Thy people’s love, discharging all<br>The duties on a king that fall?<br>Are all thy servants fostered well?<br>Do all obey, and none rebel?<br>Hast thou, destroyer of the foe,<br>No enemies to overthrow?<br>Does fortune, conqueror! still attend<br>Thy treasure, host, and every friend?<br>Is it all well? Does happy fate<br>On sons and children’s children wait?”<br><br>  He spoke. The modest king replied<br>That all was prosperous far and wide.<br><br>Thus for awhile the two conversed,<br>As each to each his tale rehearsed,<br>And as the happy moments flew,<br>Their joy and friendship stronger grew.<br>When such discourse had reached an end,<br>Thus spoke the saint most reverend<br>To royal Viśvámitra, while<br>His features brightened with a smile:<br>“O mighty lord of men. I fain<br>Would banquet thee and all thy train<br>In mode that suits thy station high:<br>And do not thou my prayer deny.<br>Let my good lord with favour take<br>The offering that I fain would make,<br>And let me honour, ere we part,<br>My royal guest with loving heart.”<br><br>  Him Viśvámitra thus addressed:<br>“Why make, O Saint, this new request?<br>Thy welcome and each gracious word<br>Sufficient honour have conferred.<br>Thou gavest roots and fruit to eat,<br>The treasures of this pure retreat,<br>And water for my mouth and feet;<br>And—boon I prize above the rest—<br>Thy presence has mine eyesight blest.<br>Honoured by thee in every way,<br>To whom all honour all should pay,<br>I now will go. My lord, Good-bye!<br>Regard me with a friendly eye.”<br><br>  Him speaking thus Vaśishṭha stayed,<br>And still to share his banquet prayed.<br>The will of Gádhi’s son he bent,<br>And won the monarch to consent,<br>Who spoke in answer. “Let it be,<br>Great Hermit, as it pleases thee.”<br>When, best of those who breathe the prayer,<br>He heard the king his will declare,<br>He called the cow of spotted skin,<br>All spot without, all pure within.<br>“Come, Dapple-skin,” he cried, “with speed;<br>Hear thou my words and help at need.<br>My heart is set to entertain<br>This monarch and his mighty train<br>With sumptuous meal and worthy fare;<br>Be thine the banquet to prepare.<br>Each dainty cate, each goodly dish,<br>Of six-fold taste<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">“Of old hoards and minerals in the earth, the king is entitled to
