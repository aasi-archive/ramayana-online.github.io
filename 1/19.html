birthday of Ráma. For the month<em>&nbsp;Chaitra</em> is the first of the two
months assigned to the spring; it corresponds with the latter half
of March and the former half of April in our division of the year.<em>&nbsp;Aditi</em>, the mother of the Gods, is lady of the seventh lunar
mansion which is called<em>&nbsp;Punarvasu</em>. The five planets and their
positions in the Zodiac are thus enumerated by both commentators:
the Sun in Aries, Mars in Capricorn, Saturn in Libra, Jupiter in
Cancer, Venus in Pisces.… I leave to astronomers to examine whether
the parts of the description agree with one another, and, if this be
the case, thence to deduce the date. The Indians place the nativity
of Ráma in the confines of the second age (tretá) and the third
(dwápara): but it seems that this should be taken in an allegorical
sense.… We may consider that the poet had an eye to the time in
which, immediately before his own age, the aspects of the heavenly
bodies were such as he has described.” SCHLEGEL.
