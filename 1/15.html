“In the meantime she traced around him, with wavering steps, the
propitiation, which some have thought has been derived from the
Druidical mythology. It consists, as is well known, in the person
who makes the<em>&nbsp;deasil</em> walking three times round the person who is
the object of the ceremony, taking care to move according to the
course of the sun.”
