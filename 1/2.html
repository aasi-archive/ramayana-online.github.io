fanciful.

divine triad of India. The four heads with which he is represented
are supposed to have allusion to the four corners of the earth which
he is sometimes considered to personify. As an object of adoration
Brahmá has been entirely superseded by Śiva and Vishṇu. In the whole
of India there is, I believe, but one temple dedicated to his
worship. In this point the first of the Indian triad curiously
resembles the last of the divine fraternity of Greece, Aïdes the
brother of Zeus and Poseidon. “In all Greece, says Pausanias, there
is no single temple of Aïdes, except at a single spot in Elis.” See
Gladstone’s Juventus Mundi, p. 253.

unfinished edition of the Rámáyan, “that, by the favour of the
Supreme Deity, I have been allowed to begin so great a work; I glory
and make my boast that I too after so many ages have helped to
confirm that ancient oracle declared to Válmíki by the Father of
Gods and men:

Dum stabunt montes, campis dum flumina current,
