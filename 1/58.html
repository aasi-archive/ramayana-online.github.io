sons after applying in vain to their father, could be charged with
resorting to another<em>&nbsp;śákhá</em> (School) in the ordinary sense of that
word; as it is not conceivable that the sons should have been of
another Śákhá from the father, whose cause they espouse with so much
warmth. The commentator in the Bombay edition explains the word<em>&nbsp;Śákhantaram</em> as Yájanádiná rakshántaram, ‘one who by sacrificing
for thee, etc., will be another protector.’ Gorresio’s Gauḍa text,
which may often be used as a commentary on the older one, has the
following paraphrase of the words in question, ch. 60, 3. Múlam
utsṛijya kasmát tvam sákhásv ichhasi lambitum. ‘Why, forsaking the
root, dost thou desire to hang upon the branches?’ ” MUIR, Sanskrit
Texts, Vol. I., p. 401.
