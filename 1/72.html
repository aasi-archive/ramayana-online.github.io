                            When royal Janak’s words were done,<br>Joined with Vaśishṭha Kuśik’s son,<br>The mighty sage began his speech:<br>“No mind may soar, no thought can reach<br>The glories of Ikshváku’s line,<br>Or, great Videha’s King, of thine:<br>None in the whole wide world may vie<br>With them in fame and honours high.<br>Well matched, I ween, in holy bands,<br>These peerless pairs will join their hands.<br>But hear me as I speak once more;<br>Thy brother, skilled in duty’s lore,<br>Has at his home a royal pair<br>Of daughters most divinely fair.<br>I for the hands of these sweet two<br>For Bharat and Śatrughna sue,<br>Both princes of heroic mould,<br>Wise, fair of form, and lofty-souled.<br>All Daśaratha’s sons, I ween,<br>Own each young grace of form and mien:<br>Brave as the Gods are they, nor yield<br>To the great Lords the worlds who shield.<br>By these, good Prince of merits high,<br>Ikshváku’s house with thine ally.”<br><br>  The suit the holy sage preferred,<br>With willing ear the monarch heard:<br>Vaśishṭha’s lips the counsel praised:<br>Then spake the king with hands upraised:<br>“Now blest indeed my race I deem,<br>Which your high will, O Saints supreme,<br>With Daśaratha’s house unites<br>In bonds of love and marriage rites.<br>So be it done. My nieces twain<br>Let Bharat and Śatrughna gain,<br>And the four youths the selfsame day<br>Four maiden hands in theirs shall lay.<br>No day so lucky may compare,<br>For marriage—so the wise declare—<br>With the last day of Phálguni<br>Ruled by the genial deity.”<br>Then with raised hands in reverence due<br>To those arch-saints he spoke anew:<br>“I am your pupil, ever true:<br>To me high favour have ye shown;<br>Come, sit ye on my royal throne,<br>For Daśaratha rules these towers<br>E’en as Ayodhyá now is ours.<br>Do with your own whate’er ye choose:<br>Your lordship here will none refuse.”<br><br>  He spoke, and to Videha’s king<br>Thus Daśaratha, answering:<br>“Boundless your virtues, lords, whose sway<br>The realms of Mithilá obey.<br>With honouring care you entertain.<br>Both holy sage and royal train.<br>Now to my house my steps I bend—<br>May blessings still on you at end—<br>Due offerings to the shades to pay.”<br>Thus spoke the king, and turned away:<br>To Janak first he bade adieu,<br>Then followed fast those holy two.<br>The monarch reached his palace where<br>The rites were paid with solemn care.<br>When the next sun began to shine<br>He rose and made his gift of kine.<br>A hundred thousand cows prepared<br>For each young prince the Bráhmans shared.<br>Each had her horns adorned with gold;<br>And duly was the number told,<br>Four hundred thousand perfect tale:<br>Each brought a calf, each filled a pail.<br>And when that glorious task was o’er,<br>The monarch with his children four,<br>Showed like the Lord of Life divine<br>When the worlds’ guardians round him shine.
