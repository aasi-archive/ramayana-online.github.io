                            Thus spoke the prince of boundless might,<br>And thus replied the anchorite:<br>“Chief of the mighty arm, of yore<br>Lord Vishṇu whom the Gods adore,<br>For holy thought and rites austere<br>Of penance made his dwelling here.<br>This ancient wood was called of old<br>Grove of the Dwarf, the mighty-souled,<br>And when perfection he attained<br>The grove the name of Perfect gained.<br>Bali of yore, Virochan’s son,<br>Dominion over Indra won,<br>And when with power his proud heart swelled,<br>O’er the three worlds his empire held.<br>When Bali then began a rite,<br>The Gods and Indra in affright<br>Sought Vishṇu in this place of rest,<br>And thus with prayers the God addressed:<br>“Bali. Virochan’s mighty son,<br>His sacrifice has now begun:<br>Of boundless wealth, that demon king<br>Is bounteous to each living thing.<br>Though suppliants flock from every side<br>The suit of none is e’er denied.<br>Whate’er, where’er howe’er the call,<br>He hears the suit and gives to all.<br>Now with thine own illusive art<br>Perform, O Lord, the helper’s part:<br>Assume a dwarfish form, and thus<br>From fear and danger rescue us.”<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">I omit, after this line, eight<em>&nbsp;ślokes</em> which, as Schlegel allows,

his rising, culmination, and setting.

</span></span><br>The whole broad earth from side to side<br>He measured with one mighty stride,<br>Spanned with the next the firmament,<br>And with the third through heaven he went.<br>Thus was the king of demons hurled<br>By Vishṇu to the nether world,<br>And thus the universe restored<br>To Indra’s rule, its ancient lord.<br>And now because the immortal God<br>This spot in dwarflike semblance trod,<br>The grove has aye been loved by me<br>For reverence of the devotee.<br>But demons haunt it, prompt to stay<br>Each holy offering I would pay.<br>Be thine, O lion-lord, to kill<br>These giants that delight in ill.<br>This day, beloved child, our feet<br>Shall rest within the calm retreat:<br>And know, thou chief of Raghu’s line,<br>My hermitage is also thine.”<br><br>  He spoke; and soon the anchorite,<br>With joyous looks that beamed delight,<br>With Ráma and his brother stood<br>Within the consecrated wood.<br>Soon as they saw the holy man,<br>With one accord together ran<br>The dwellers in the sacred shade,<br>And to the saint their reverence paid,<br>And offered water for his feet,<br>The gift of honour and a seat;<br>And next with hospitable care<br>They entertained the princely pair.<br>The royal tamers of their foes<br>Rested awhile in sweet repose:<br>Then to the chief of hermits sued<br>Standing in suppliant attitude:<br>“Begin, O best of saints, we pray,<br>Initiatory rites to-day.<br>This Perfect Grove shall be anew<br>Made perfect, and thy words be true.”<br><br>  Then, thus addressed, the holy man,<br>The very glorious sage, began<br>The high preliminary rite.<br>Restraining sense and appetite.<br>Calmly the youths that night reposed,<br>And rose when morn her light disclosed,<br>Their morning worship paid, and took<br>Of lustral water from the brook.<br>Thus purified they breathed the prayer,<br>Then greeted Viśvámitra where<br>As celebrant he sate beside<br>The flame with sacred oil supplied.
