                            Then from Himálaya’s heights of snow,<br>The glorious saint prepared to go,<br>And dwelling in the distant east<br>His penance and his toil increased.<br>A thousand years his lips he held<br>Closed by a vow unparalleled,<br>And other marvels passing thought,<br>Unrivalled in the world, he wrought.<br>In all the thousand years his frame<br>Dry as a log of wood became.<br>By many a cross and check beset,<br>Rage had not stormed his bosom yet.<br>With iron will that naught could bend<br>He plied his labour till the end.<br>So when the weary years were o’er,<br>Freed from his vow so stern and sore,<br>The hermit, all his penance sped,<br>Sate down to eat his meal of bread.<br>Then Indra, clad in Bráhman guise,<br>Asked him for food with hungry eyes.<br>The mighty saint, with steadfast soul,<br>To the false Bráhman gave the whole,<br>And when no scrap for him remained,<br>Fasting and faint, from speech refrained.<br>His silent vow he would not break:<br>No breath he heaved, no word he spake,<br>Then as he checked his breath, behold!<br>Around his brow thick smoke-clouds rolled<br>And the three worlds, as if o’erspread<br>With ravening flames, were filled with dread.<br>Then God and saint and bard, convened,<br>And Nága lord, and snake, and fiend,<br>Thus to the General Father cried,<br>Distracted, sad, and terrified:<br>“Against the hermit, sore assailed,<br>Lure, scathe, and scorn have naught availed,<br>Proof against rage and treacherous art<br>He keeps his vow with constant heart.<br>Now if his toils assist him naught<br>To gain the boon his soul has sought,<br>He through the worlds will ruin send<br>That fixt and moving things shall end,<br>The regions now are dark with doom,<br>No friendly ray relieves the gloom.<br>Each ocean foams with maddened tide,<br>The shrinking hills in fear subside.<br>Trembles the earth with feverous throe<br>The wind in fitful tempest blows.<br>No cure we see with troubled eyes:<br>And atheist brood on earth may rise.<br>The triple world is wild with care,<br>Or spiritless in dull despair.<br>Before that saint the sun is dim,<br>His blessed light eclipsed by him.<br>Now ere the saint resolve to bring<br>Destruction on each living thing,<br>Let us appease, while yet we may,<br>Him bright as fire, like fire to slay.<br>Yea, as the fiery flood of Fate<br>Lays all creation desolate,<br>He o’er the conquered Gods may reign:<br>O, grant him what he longs to gain.”<br><br>Then all the Blest, by Brahmá led,<br>Approached the saint and sweetly said:<br>“Hail, Bráhman Saint! for such thy place:<br>Thy vows austere have won our grace.<br>A Bráhman’s rank thy penance stern<br>And ceaseless labour richly earn.<br>I with the Gods of Storm decree<br>Long life, O Bráhman Saint, to thee.<br>May peace and joy thy soul possess:<br>Go where thou wilt in happiness.”<br><br>  Thus by the General Sire addressed,<br>Joy and high triumph filled his breast.<br>His head in adoration bowed,<br>Thus spoke he to the Immortal crowd:<br>“If I, ye Gods, have gained at last<br>Both length of days and Bráhman caste,<br>Grant that the high mysterious name,<br>And holy Vedas, own my claim,<br>And that the formula to bless<br>The sacrifice, its lord confess.<br>And let Vaśishṭha, who excels<br>In Warriors’ art and mystic spells,<br>In love of God without a peer,<br>Confirm the boon you promise here.”<br><br>  With Brahmá’s son Vaśishṭha, best<br>Of those who pray with voice repressed,<br>The Gods by earnest prayer prevailed,<br>And thus his new-made friend he hailed:<br>“Thy title now is sure and good<br>To rights of saintly Bráhmanhood.”<br>Thus spake the sage. The Gods, content,<br>Back to their heavenly mansions went.<br>And Viśvámitra, pious-souled,<br>Among the Bráhman saints enrolled,<br>On reverend Vaśishṭha pressed<br>The honours due to holy guest.<br>Successful in his high pursuit,<br>The sage, in penance resolute,<br>Walked in his pilgrim wanderings o’er<br>The whole broad land from shore to shore.<br>’Twas thus the saint, O Raghu’s son,<br>His rank among the Bráhmans won.<br>Best of all hermits, Prince, is he;<br>In him incarnate Penance see.<br>Friend of the right, who shrinks from ill,<br>Heroic powers attend him still.”<br><br>  The Bráhman, versed in ancient lore,<br>Thus closed his tale, and said no more,<br>To Śatánanda Kuśik’s son<br>Cried in delight, Well done! well done!<br>Then Janak, at the tale amazed,<br>Spoke thus with suppliant hands upraised:<br>“High fate is mine, O Sage, I deem,<br>And thanks I owe for bliss supreme,<br>That thou and Raghu’s children too<br>Have come my sacrifice to view.<br>To look on thee with blessed eyes<br>Exalts my soul and purifies.<br>Yea, thus to see thee face to face<br>Enriches me with store of grace.<br>Thy holy labours wrought of old,<br>And mighty penance, fully told,<br>Ráma and I with great delight<br>Have heard, O glorious Anchorite.<br>Unrivalled thine ascetic deeds:<br>Thy might, O Saint, all might exceeds.<br>No thought may scan, no limit bound<br>The virtues that in thee are found.<br>The story of thy wondrous fate<br>My thirsty ears can never sate.<br>The hour of evening rites is near:<br>The sun declines in swift career.<br>At early dawn, O Hermit, deign<br>To let me see thy face again.<br>Best of ascetics, part in bliss:<br>Do thou thy servant now dismiss.”<br><br>  The saint approved, and glad and kind<br>Dismissed the king with joyful mind<br>Around the sage King Janak went<br>With priests and kinsmen reverent.<br>Then Viśvámitra, honoured so,<br>By those high-minded, rose to go,<br>And with the princes took his way<br>To seek the lodging where they lay.
