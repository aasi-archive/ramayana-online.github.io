Indus, in the plural of the people and territories on its banks. The
name appears as<em>&nbsp;Hidku</em> in the cuneiform inscription of Darius’ son
of Hystaspes, in which the nations tributary to that king are
enumerated.

The Hebrew form is<em>&nbsp;Hodda</em> (Esther, I. 1.). In Zend it appears as<em>&nbsp;Hendu</em> in a somewhat wider sense. With the Persians later the
signification of<em>&nbsp;Hind</em> seems to have co-extended with their
increasing acquaintance with the country. The weak Ionic dialect
omitted the Persian<em>&nbsp;h</em>, and we find in Hecatæus and Herodotus Ἴνδος
and ἡ Ἰνδική. In this form the Romans received the names and
transmitted them to us. The Arabian geographers in their ignorance
that Hind and Sind are two forms of the same word have made of them
two brothers and traced their decent from Noah. See Lassen’s
Indische Alterthumskunde Vol. I. pp. 2, 3.

that the name is etymologically connected with<em>&nbsp;Cambyses</em> which in
the cuneiform inscription of Behistun is written Ka(m)bujia.

proportioned, has an erect head, a broad chest, large ears, a long
tail, and is bold and can bear fatigue. 2<em>&nbsp;Mand</em>. It is black, has
yellow eyes, a uniformly sized body, and is wild and ungovernable. 3<em>&nbsp;Mirg</em>. It has a whitish skin, with black spots. 4<em>&nbsp;Mir</em>. It has a
small head, and obeys readily. It gets frightened when it thunders.”<em>&nbsp;Aín-i-Akbarí.</em>. Translated by H. Blochmann, Aín 41,<em>&nbsp;The Imperial
