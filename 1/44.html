great Prince of men, well done!<br>Thy kinsmen bliss and heaven have won.<br>The sons of Sagar mighty-souled,<br>Are with the Blest, as Gods, enrolled,<br>Long as the Ocean’s flood shall stand<br>Upon the border of the land,<br>So long shall Sagar’s sons remain,<br>And, godlike, rank in heaven retain.<br>Gangá thine eldest child shall be,<br>Called from thy name Bhágirathí;<br>Named also—for her waters fell<br>From heaven and flow through earth and hell—<br>Tripathagá, stream of the skies,<br>Because three paths she glorifies.<br>And, mighty King, ’tis given thee now<br>To free thee and perform thy vow.<br>No longer, happy Prince, delay<br>Drink-offerings to thy kin to pay.<br>For this the holiest Sagar sighed,<br>But mourned the boon he sought denied.<br>Then Anśumán, dear Prince! although<br>No brighter name the world could show,<br>Strove long the heavenly flood to gain<br>To visit earth, but strove in vain.<br>Nor was she by the sages’ peer,<br>Blest with all virtues, most austere,<br>Thy sire Dilípa, hither brought,<br>Though with fierce prayers the boon he sought.<br>But thou, O King, earned success,<br>And won high fame which God will bless.<br>Through thee, O victor of thy foes,<br>On earth this heavenly Gangá flows,<br>And thou hast gained the meed divine<br>That waits on virtue such as thine.<br>Now in her ever holy wave<br>Thyself, O best of heroes, lave:<br>So shalt thou, pure from every sin,<br>The blessed fruit of merit win.<br>Now for thy kin who died of yore<br>The meet libations duly pour.<br>Above the heavens I now ascend:<br>Depart, and bliss thy steps attend.”<br><br>  Thus to the mighty king who broke<br>His foemens’ might, Lord Brahmá spoke,<br>And with his Gods around him rose<br>To his own heaven of blest repose.<br>The royal sage no more delayed,<br>But, the libation duly paid,<br>Home to his regal city hied<br>With water cleansed and purified.<br>There ruled he his ancestral state,<br>Best of all men, most fortunate.<br>And all the people joyed again<br>In good Bhagírath’s gentle reign.<br>Rich, prosperous, and blest were they,<br>And grief and sickness fled away.<br>Thus, Ráma, I at length have told<br>How Gangá came from heaven of old.<br>Now, for the evening passes swift,<br>I wish thee each auspicious gift.<br>This story of the flood’s descent<br>Will give—for ’tis most excellent—<br>Wealth, purity, fame, length of days,<br>And to the skies its hearers raise”
