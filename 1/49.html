                            Then Ráma, following still his guide,<br>Within the grove, with Lakshmaṇ, hied,<br>Her vows a wondrous light had lent<br>To that illustrious penitent.<br>He saw the glorious lady, screened<br>From eye of man, and God, and fiend,<br>Like some bright portent which the care<br>Of Brahmá launches through the air,<br>Designed by his illusive art<br>To flash a moment and depart:<br>Or like the flame that leaps on high<br>To sink involved in smoke and die:<br>Or like the full moon shining through<br>The wintry mist, then lost to view:<br>Or like the sun’s reflection, cast<br>Upon the flood, too bright to last:<br>So was the glorious dame till then<br>Removed from Gods’ and mortals’ ken,<br>Till—such was Gautam’s high decree—<br>Prince Ráma came to set her free.<br><br>  Then, with great joy that dame to meet,<br>The sons of Raghu clapped her feet;<br>And she, remembering Gautam’s oath,<br>With gentle grace received them both;<br>Then water for their feet she gave,<br>Guest-gift, and all that strangers crave.<br><br>  The prince, of courteous rule aware,<br>Received, as meet, the lady’s care.<br>Then flowers came down in copious rain,<br>And moving to the heavenly strain<br>Of music in the skies that rang,<br>The nymphs and minstrels danced and sang:<br>And all the Gods with one glad voice<br>Praised the great dame, and cried, “Rejoice!<br>Through fervid rites no more defiled,<br>But with thy husband reconciled.”<br>Gautam, the holy hermit knew—<br>For naught escaped his godlike view—<br>That Ráma lodged beneath that shade,<br>And hasting there his homage paid.<br>He took Ahalyá to his side,<br>From sin and folly purified,<br>And let his new-found consort bear<br>In his austerities a share.<br><br>  Then Ráma, pride of Raghu’s race,<br>Welcomed by Gautam, face to face,<br>Who every highest honour showed,<br>To Mithilá pursued his road.
