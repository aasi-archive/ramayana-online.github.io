region between the northern highlands of the Himálayas and mount
Kailása, the region of the sacred lakes. The poem, following the
popular Indian belief, makes the river Sarayú (now Sarjú) flow from
the Mánasa lake; the sources of the river are a little to the south
about a day’s journey from the lake. See Lassen,<em>&nbsp;Indische
Alterthumshunde</em>, page 34.” GORRESIO.<em>&nbsp;Manas</em> means mind;<em>&nbsp;mánasa</em>,
