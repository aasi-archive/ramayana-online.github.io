                            Three nights upon the road they passed<br>To rest the steeds that bore them fast,<br>And reached Ayodhyá’s town at last.<br>Then straight at Daśaratha’s call<br>They stood within the royal hall,<br>Where, like a God, inspiring awe,<br>The venerable king they saw.<br>With suppliant palm to palm applied,<br>And all their terror laid aside,<br>They spoke to him upon the throne<br>With modest words, in gentle tone:<br>“Janak, Videha’s king, O Sire,<br>Has sent us hither to inquire<br>The health of thee his friend most dear,<br>Of all thy priests and every peer.<br>Next Kuśik’s son consenting, thus<br>King Janak speaks, dread liege, by us:<br>“I made a promise and decree<br>That valour’s prize my child should be.<br>Kings, worthless found in worth’s assay,<br>With mien dejected turned away.<br>Thy sons, by Viśvámitra led,<br>Unurged, my city visited,<br>And peerless in their might have gained<br>My daughter, as my vow ordained.<br>Full in a vast assembly’s view<br>Thy hero Ráma broke in two<br>The gem of bows, of monstrous size,<br>That came a treasure from the skies.<br>Ordained the prize of hero’s might,<br>Sítá my child is his by right.<br>Fain would I keep my promise made,<br>If thou, O King, approve and aid.<br>Come to my town thy son to see:<br>Bring holy guide and priest with thee.<br>O lord of kings, my suit allow,<br>And let me keep my promised vow.<br>So joying for thy children’s sake<br>Their triumph too shalt thou partake,<br>With Viśvámitra’s high consent.”<br>Such words with friendship eloquent<br>Spoke Janak, fair Videha’s king,<br>By Śatánanda’s counselling.”<br><br>  The envoys thus the king addressed,<br>And mighty joy his heart possessed.<br>To Vámadeva quick he cried,<br>Vaśishṭha, and his lords beside:<br>“Lakshmaṇ, and he, my princely boy<br>Who fills Kauśalyá’s soul with joy,<br>By Viśvámitra guarded well<br>Among the good Videhans dwell.<br>Their ruler Janak, prompt to own<br>The peerless might my child has shown,<br>To him would knit in holy ties<br>His daughter, valour’s lovely prize.<br>If Janak’s plan seem good to you,<br>Come, speed we to his city too,<br>Nor let occasion idly by.”<br><br>  He ceased. There came a glad reply<br>From priest and mighty saint and all<br>The councillors who thronged the hall.<br>Then cried the king with joyous heart:<br>“To-morrow let us all depart.”<br><br>  That night the envoys entertained<br>With honour and all care remained.
