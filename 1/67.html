                            Then spoke again the great recluse:<br>“This mighty bow, O King, produce.”<br>King Janak, at the saint’s request,<br>This order to his train addressed:<br>“Let the great bow be hither borne,<br>Which flowery wreaths and scents adorn.”<br>Soon as the monarch’s words were said,<br>His servants to the city sped,<br>Five thousand youths in number, all<br>Of manly strength and stature tall,<br>The ponderous eight-wheeled chest that held<br>The heavenly bow, with toil propelled.<br>At length they brought that iron chest,<br>And thus the godlike king addressed:<br>“This best of bows, O lord, we bring,<br>Respected by each chief and king,<br>And place it for these youths to see,<br>If, Sovereign, such thy pleasure be.”<br><br>  With suppliant palm to palm applied<br>King Janak to the strangers cried:<br>“This gem of bows, O Bráhman Sage,<br>Our race has prized from age to age,<br>Too strong for those who yet have reigned,<br>Though great in might each nerve they strained.<br>Titan and fiend its strength defies,<br>God, spirit, minstrel of the skies.<br>And bard above and snake below<br>Are baffled by this glorious bow.<br>Then how may human prowess hope<br>With such a bow as this to cope?<br>What man with valour’s choicest gift<br>This bow can draw, or string, or lift?<br>Yet let the princes, holy Seer,<br>Behold it: it is present here.”<br><br>  Then spoke the hermit pious-souled:<br>“Ráma, dear son, the bow behold.”<br>Then Ráma at his word unclosed<br>The chest wherein its might reposed,<br>Thus crying, as he viewed it: “Lo!<br>I lay mine hand upon the bow:<br>May happy luck my hope attend<br>Its heavenly strength to lift or bend.”<br>“Good luck be thine,” the hermit cried:<br>“Assay the task!” the king replied.<br>Then Raghu’s son, as if in sport,<br>Before the thousands of the court,<br>The weapon by the middle raised<br>That all the crowd in wonder gazed.<br>With steady arm the string he drew<br>Till burst the mighty bow in two.<br>As snapped the bow, an awful clang,<br>Loud as the shriek of tempests, rang.<br>The earth, affrighted, shook amain<br>As when a hill is rent in twain.<br>Then, senseless at the fearful sound,<br>The people fell upon the ground:<br>None save the king, the princely pair,<br>And the great saint, the shock could bear.<br><br>  When woke to sense the stricken train,<br>And Janak’s soul was calm again,<br>With suppliant hands and reverent head,<br>These words, most eloquent, he said:<br>“O Saint, Prince Ráma stands alone:<br>His peerless might he well has shown.<br>A marvel has the hero wrought<br>Beyond belief, surpassing thought.<br>My child, to royal Ráma wed,<br>New glory on our line will shed:<br>And true my promise will remain<br>That hero’s worth the bride should gain.<br>Dearer to me than light and life,<br>My Sítá shall be Ráma’s wife.<br>If thou, O Bráhman, leave concede,<br>My counsellors, with eager speed,<br>Borne in their flying cars, to fair<br>Ayodhyá’s town the news shall bear,<br>With courteous message to entreat<br>The king to grace my royal seat.<br>This to the monarch shall they tell,<br>The bride is his who won her well:<br>And his two sons are resting here<br>Protected by the holy seer.<br>So, at his pleasure, let them lead<br>The sovereign to my town with speed.”<br><br>  The hermit to his prayer inclined<br>And Janak, lord of virtuous mind,<br>With charges, to Ayodhyá sent<br>His ministers: and forth they went.
