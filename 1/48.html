the night; and as the night is seduced and ruined by the sun of the

I long to know<br>What hermit dwelt here long ago.”<br>Then to the prince his holy guide,<br>Most eloquent of men, replied:<br>“O Ráma, listen while I tell<br>Whose was this grove, and what befell<br>When in the fury of his rage<br>The high saint cursed the hermitage.<br>This was the grove—most lovely then—<br>Of Gautam, O thou best of men,<br>Like heaven itself, most honoured by<br>The Gods who dwell above the sky.<br>Here with Ahalyá at his side<br>His fervid task the ascetic plied.<br>Years fled in thousands.
