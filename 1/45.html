                            High and more high their wonder rose<br>As the strange story reached its close,<br>And thus, with Lakshmaṇ, Ráma, best<br>Of Raghu’s sons, the saint addressed:<br>“Most wondrous is the tale which thou<br>Hast told of heavenly Gangá, how<br>From realms above descending she<br>Flowed through the land and filled the sea.<br>In thinking o’er what thou hast said<br>The night has like a moment fled,<br>Whose hours in musing have been spent<br>Upon thy words most excellent:<br>So much, O holy Sage, thy lore<br>Has charmed us with this tale of yore.”<br><br>  Day dawned.

recurring name of Vishṇu. The Indians also, therefore, knew the art
of making bows out of the hons of antelopes or wild goats, which
Homer ascribes to the Trojans of the heroic age.” SCHLEGEL.

</span></span><br>The poisoned flood at once he quaffed<br>As ’twere the Amrit’s heavenly draught.<br>Then from the Gods departing went<br>Śiva, the Lord pre-eminent.<br>The host of Gods and Asurs still<br>Kept churning with one heart and will.<br>But Mandar’s mountain, whirling round,<br>Pierced to the depths below the ground.<br>Then Gods and bards in terror flew<br>To him who mighty Madhu slew.<br>“Help of all beings! more than all,<br>The Gods on thee for aid may call.<br>Ward off, O mighty-armed! our fate,<br>And bear up Mandar’s threatening weight.”<br>Then Vishṇu, as their need was sore,<br>The semblance of a tortoise wore,<br>And in the bed of Ocean lay<br>The mountain on his back to stay.<br>Then he, the soul pervading all,<br>Whose locks in radiant tresses fall,<br>One mighty arm extended still,<br>And grasped the summit of the hill.<br>So ranged among the Immortals, he<br>Joined in the churning of the sea.<br><br>  A thousand years had reached their close,<br>When calmly from the ocean rose<br>The gentle sage<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Dhanvantari, the physician of the Gods.

the locative case plural of<em>&nbsp;ap</em>, water, and<em>&nbsp;rasa</em>, taste.… The
word is probably derived from<em>&nbsp;ap</em>, water, and<em>&nbsp;sri</em>, to go, and
seems to signify<em>&nbsp;inhabitants of the water</em>, nymphs of the stream;
or, as Goldstücker thinks (Dict. s.v.) these divinities were
originally personifications of the vapours which are attracted by
the sun and form into mist or clouds.

</span></span><br>Each had her maids. The tongue would fail—<br>So vast the throng—to count the tale.<br>But when no God or Titan wooed<br>A wife from all that multitude,<br>Refused by all, they gave their love<br>In common to the Gods above.<br>Then from the sea still vext and wild<br>Rose Surá,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text"><em>&nbsp;Surá</em>, in the feminine comprehends all sorts of intoxicating
liquors, many kinds of which the Indians from the earliest times
distilled and prepared from rice, sugar-cane, the palm tree, and
various flowers and plants. Nothing is considered more disgraceful
among orthodox Hindus than drunkenness, and the use of wine is
forbidden not only to Bráhmans but the two other orders as well.… So
it clearly appears derogatory to the dignity of the Gods to have
received a nymph so pernicious, who ought rather to have been made
over to the Titans. However the etymological fancy has prevailed.
The word<em>&nbsp;Sura</em>, a God, is derived from the indeclinable<em>&nbsp;Swar</em>
heaven.” SCHLEGEL.

antiquity is evident from one of her names<em>&nbsp;Kshírábdhi-tanayá</em>,
daughter of the Milky Sea, which is found in<em>&nbsp;Amarasinha</em> the most
ancient of Indian lexicographers. The similarity to the Greek myth
of Venus being born from the foam of the sea is remarkable.”

“In this description of Lakshmí one thing only offends me, that she
is said to have four arms. Each of Vishṇu’s arms, single, as far as
the elbow, there branches into two; but Lakshmí in all the brass
seals that I possess or remember to have seen has two arms only. Nor
does this deformity of redundant limbs suit the pattern of perfect
beauty.” SCHLEGEL. I have omitted the offensive epithet.
