the primary meaning of which is<em>&nbsp;the act of seizing</em>. A magical
power seems to be implied of employing the weapons when and where
required. The remarks I have made on the preceding Canto apply with
still greater force to this. The MSS. greatly vary in the
enumeration of these<em>&nbsp;Sankáras</em>, and it is not surprising that
copyists have incorrectly written the names which they did not well
understand. The commentators throw no light upon the subject.”
SCHLEGEL. I have taken the liberty of omitting four of these which
Schlegel translates “Scleromphalum, Euomphalum, Centiventrem, and
Chrysomphalum.”

                            Pure, with glad cheer and joyful breast,<br>Of those mysterious arms possessed,<br>Ráma, now passing on his way,<br>Thus to the saint began to say:<br>“Lord of these mighty weapons, I<br>Can scarce be harmed by Gods on high;<br>Now, best of saints, I long to gain<br>The powers that can these arms restrain.”<br>Thus spoke the prince. The sage austere,<br>True to his vows, from evil clear,<br>Called forth the names of those great charms<br>Whose powers restrain the deadly arms.<br>“Receive thou True and Truly famed,<br>And Bold and Fleet: the weapons named<br>Warder and Progress, swift of pace,<br>Averted-head and Drooping-face;<br>The Seen, and that which Secret flies;<br>The weapon of the thousand eyes;<br>Ten-headed, and the Hundred-faced,<br>Star-gazer and the Layer-waste:<br>The Omen-bird, the Pure-from-spot,<br>The pair that wake and slumber not:<br>The Fiendish, that which shakes amain,<br>The Strong-of-Hand, the Rich-in-Gain:<br>The Guardian, and the Close-allied,<br>The Gaper, Love, and Golden-side:<br>O Raghu’s son receive all these,<br>Bright ones that wear what forms they please;<br>Kriśáśva’s mystic sons are they,<br>And worthy thou their might to sway.”<br>With joy the pride of Raghu’s race<br>Received the hermit’s proffered grace,<br>Mysterious arms, to check and stay,<br>Or smite the foeman in the fray.<br>Then, all with heavenly forms endued,<br>Nigh came the wondrous multitude.<br>Celestial in their bright attire<br>Some shone like coals of burning fire;<br>Some were like clouds of dusky smoke;<br>And suppliant thus they sweetly spoke:<br>“Thy thralls, O Ráma, here we stand:<br>Command, we pray, thy faithful band”<br>“Depart,” he cried, “where each may list,<br>But when I call you to assist,<br>Be present to my mind with speed,<br>And aid me in the hour of need.”<br><br>  To Ráma then they lowly bent,<br>And round him in due reverence went,<br>To his command, they answered, Yea,<br>And as they came so went away.<br>When thus the arms had homeward flown,<br>With pleasant words and modest tone,<br>E’en as he walked, the prince began<br>To question thus the holy man:<br>“What cloudlike wood is that which near<br>The mountain’s side I see appear?<br>O tell me, for I long to know;<br>Its pleasant aspect charms me so.<br>Its glades are full of deer at play,<br>And sweet birds sing on every spray,<br>Past is the hideous wild; I feel<br>So sweet a tremor o’er me steal,<br>And hail with transport fresh and new<br>A land that is so fair to view.<br>Then tell me all, thou holy Sage,<br>And whose this pleasant hermitage<br>In which those wicked ones delight<br>To mar and kill each holy rite.<br>And with foul heart and evil deed<br>Thy sacrifice, great Saint, impede.<br>To whom, O Sage, belongs this land<br>In which thine altars ready stand!<br>’Tis mine to guard them, and to slay<br>The giants who the rites would stay.<br>All this, O best of saints, I burn<br>From thine own lips, my lord, to learn.”
