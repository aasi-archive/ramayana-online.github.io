                            The haughty challenge, undeterred<br>The son of Daśaratha heard,<br>And cried, while reverence for his sire<br>Checked the full torrent of his ire:<br>“Before this day have I been told<br>The deed that stained thy hands of old.<br>But pity bids my soul forget:<br>Thy father, murdered, claimed the debt.<br>My strength, O Chief, thou deemest slight,<br>Too feeble for a Warrior’s might.<br>Now will I show thy wondering eyes<br>The prowess which they dare despise.”<br><br>  He hastened then with graceful ease<br>That mighty bow and shaft to seize.<br>His hand the weapon strung and swayed:<br>The arrow on the string was laid.<br>Then Jamadagni’s son he eyed,<br>And thus in words of fury cried:<br>“Thou art a Bráhman, still to be<br>Most highly honoured, Chief, by me.<br>For Viśvámitra’s sake beside<br>Shall reverence due be ne’er denied.<br>Though mine the power, I would not send<br>A dart at thee thy life to end.<br>But thy great power to wander free,<br>Which penance-rites have won for thee,<br>Or glorious worlds from thee to wrest,<br>Is the firm purpose of my breast,<br>And Vishṇu’s dart which now I strain<br>Can ne’er be shot to fall in vain:<br>It strikes the mighty, and it stuns<br>The madness of the haughty ones.”<br><br>  Then Gods, and saints and heavenly choir<br>Preceded by the General Sire,<br>Met in the air and gazed below<br>On Ráma with that wondrous bow.<br>Nymph, minstrel, angel, all were there,<br>Snake-God, and spirit of the air,<br>Giant, and bard, and gryphon, met,<br>Their eyes upon the marvel set.<br>In senseless hush the world was chained<br>While Ráma’s hand the bow retained,<br>And Jamadagni’s son amazed<br>And powerless on the hero gazed.<br>Then when his swelling heart had shrunk,<br>And his proud strength in torpor sunk,<br>Scarce his voice ventured, low and weak,<br>To Ráma lotus-eyed, to speak:<br>“When long ago I gave away<br>The whole broad land to Kaśyap’s sway<br>He charged me never to remain<br>Within the limits of his reign.<br>Obedient to my guide’s behest<br>On earth by night I never rest.<br>My choice is made, I will not dim<br>Mine honour and be false to him.<br>So, son of Raghu, leave me still<br>The power to wander where I will,<br>And swifter than the thought my flight<br>Shall place me on Mahendra’s height.<br>My mansions of eternal joy,<br>By penance won, thou mayst destroy,<br>My path to these thy shaft may stay.<br>Now to the work! No more delay!<br>I know thee Lord of Gods; I know<br>Thy changeless might laid Madhu low.<br>All other hands would surely fail<br>To bend this bow. All hail! all hail!<br>See! all the Gods have left the skies<br>To bend on thee their eager eyes,<br>With whose achievements none compete,<br>Whose arm in war no God can meet.<br>No shame is mine, I ween, for thou,<br>Lord of the Worlds, hast dimmed my brow.<br>Now, pious Ráma, ’tis thy part<br>To shoot afar that glorious dart:<br>I, when the fatal shaft is shot,<br>Will seek that hill and tarry not.”<br><br>  He ceased. The wondrous arrow flew,<br>And Jamadagni’s offspring knew<br>Those glorious worlds to him were barred,<br>Once gained by penance long and hard.<br>Then straight the airy quarters cleared,<br>And the mid regions bright appeared,<br>While Gods and saints unnumbered praised<br>Ráma, the mighty bow who raised.<br>And Jamadagni’s son, o’erawed.<br>Extolled his name with highest laud,<br>With reverent steps around him strode,<br>Then hastened on his airy road.<br>Far from the sight of all he fled,<br>And rested on Mahendra’s head.
