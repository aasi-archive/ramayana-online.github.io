                            “A great emprise, O lovely maid,<br>To save the Gods, awaits thine aid:<br>To bind the son of Kuśik sure,<br>And take his soul with love’s sweet lure.”<br>Thus order’d by the Thousand-eyed<br>The suppliant nymph in fear replied:<br>“O Lord of Gods, this mighty sage<br>Is very fierce and swift to rage.<br>I doubt not, he so dread and stern<br>On me his scorching wrath will turn.<br>Of this, my lord, am I afraid:<br>Have mercy on a timid maid.”<br>Her suppliant hands began to shake,<br>When thus again Lord Indra spake:<br>“O Rambhá, drive thy fears away,<br>And as I bid do thou obey.<br>In Koïl’s form, who takes the heart<br>When trees in spring to blossom start,<br>I, with Kandarpa for my friend,<br>Close to thy side mine aid will lend.<br>Do thou thy beauteous splendour arm<br>With every grace and winsome charm,<br>And from his awful rites seduce<br>This Kuśik’s son, the stern recluse.”<br><br>  Lord Indra ceased. The nymph obeyed:<br>In all her loveliest charms arrayed,<br>With winning ways and witching smile<br>She sought the hermit to beguile.<br>The sweet note of that tuneful bird<br>The saint with ravished bosom heard,<br>And on his heart a rapture passed<br>As on the nymph a look he cast.<br>But when he heard the bird prolong<br>His sweet incomparable song,<br>And saw the nymph with winning smile,<br>The hermit’s heart perceived the wile.<br>And straight he knew the Thousand-eyed<br>A plot against his peace had tried.<br>Then Kuśik’s son indignant laid<br>His curse upon the heavenly maid:<br>“Because thou wouldst my soul engage<br>Who fight to conquer love and rage,<br>Stand, till ten thousand years have flown,<br>Ill-fated maid, transformed to stone.<br>A Bráhman then, in glory strong,<br>Mighty through penance stern and long,<br>Shall free thee from thine altered shape;<br>Thou from my curse shalt then escape.”<br>But when the saint had cursed her so,<br>His breast was burnt with fires of woe,<br>Grieved that long effort to restrain<br>His mighty wrath was all in vain.<br>Cursed by the angry sage’s power,<br>She stood in stone that selfsame hour.<br>Kandarpa heard the words he said,<br>And quickly from his presence fled.<br>His fall beneath his passion’s sway<br>Had reft the hermit’s meed away.<br>Unconquered yet his secret foes,<br>The humbled saint refused repose:<br>“No more shall rage my bosom till,<br>Sealed be my lips, my tongue be still.<br>My very breath henceforth I hold<br>Until a thousand years are told:<br>Victorious o’er each erring sense,<br>I’ll dry my frame with abstinence,<br>Until by penance duly done<br>A Bráhman’s rank be bought and won.<br>For countless years, as still as death,<br>I taste no food, I draw no breath,<br>And as I toil my frame shall stand<br>Unharmed by time’s destroying hand.”
