the Vedic personification of an imaginary malignant influence or
demon of darkness and drought supposed to take possession of the
clouds, causing them to obstruct the clearness of the sky and keep
back the waters. Indra is represented as battling with this evil
influence, and the pent-up clouds being practically represented as
mountains or castles are shattered by his thunderbolt and made to
open their receptacles.
