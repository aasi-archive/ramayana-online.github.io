                            Then Raghu’s son, whose feeling breast<br>Shared the great woe that moved the rest,<br>Strove with wise charm their grief to ease<br>And gently spoke in words like these:<br><br>  “You ne’er can raise the dead to bliss<br>By agony of grief like this.<br>Cease your lament, nor leave undone<br>The funeral task you may not shun.<br>As nature orders o’er the dead.<br>Your tributary tears are shed,<br>But Fate, directing each event,<br>Is still the lord preëminent.<br>Yes, all obey the changeless laws<br>Of Fate the universal cause.<br>By Fate, the lives of all proceed,<br>That governs every word and deed,<br>None acts, none sees his hest obeyed,<br>But each and all by Fate are swayed.<br>The world its ordered course maintains,<br>And o’er that course Fate ever reigns.<br>Fate ne’er exceeds the rule of Fate:<br>Is ne’er too swift, is ne’er too late,<br>And making nature its ally<br>Forgets no life, nor passes by.<br>No kith and kin, no power and force<br>Can check or stay its settled course,<br>No friend or client, grace or charm,<br>That victor of the world disarm.<br>So all who see with prudent eyes<br>The hand of Fate must recognize,<br>For virtue rules, or love, or gain,<br>As Fate’s unchanged decrees ordain.<br>Báli has died and won the meed<br>That waits in heaven on noble deed,<br>Throned in the seats the brave may reach<br>By liberal hand and gentle speech,<br>True to a warrior’s duty, bold<br>In fight, the hero lofty-souled<br>Deigned not to guard his life: he died,<br>And now in heaven is glorified.<br>Then cease these tears and wild despair:<br>Turn to the task that claims your care,<br>For Báli’s is the glorious fate<br>Which warriors count most fortunate.”<br><br>  When Ráma’s speech had found a close,<br>Brave Lakshmaṇ, terror of his foes,<br>With wise and soothing words addressed<br>Sugríva still with woe oppressed:<br>“Arise Sugríva,” thus he said,<br>“Perform the service of the dead.<br>Prepare with Tárá and her son<br>That Báli’s rites be duly done.<br>A store of funeral wood provide<br>Which wind and sun and time have dried<br>And richest sandal fit to grace<br>The pyre of one of royal race.<br>With words of comfort soft and kind<br>Console poor Angad’s troubled mind,<br>Nor let thy heart be thus cast down,<br>For thine is now the Vánars’ town.<br>Let Angad’s care a wreath supply,<br>And raiment rich with varied dye,<br>And oil and perfumes for the fire,<br>And all the solemn rites require.<br>Go, hasten to the town, O King,<br>And Tárá’s little quickly bring.<br>A virtue is despatch: and speed<br>Is best of all in hour of need.<br>Go, let a chosen band prepare<br>The litter of the dead to bear.<br>For stout and tall and strong of limb<br>Must be the chiefs who carry him.”<br><br>  He spoke,—his friends’ delight and pride,—<br>Then stood again by Ráma’s side.<br>When Tára<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Vánar chief, not to be confounded with Tárá.

My lord!<br>While wood and hill and valley sent<br>In echoes back the shrill lament.<br>Then on a low and sandy isle<br>Was reared the hero’s funeral pile<br>By crowds of toiling Vánars, where<br>The mountain stream ran fresh and fair,<br>The Vánar chiefs, a noble band,<br>Had laid the litter on the sand,<br>And stood a little space apart,<br>Each mourning in his inmost heart.<br>But Tárá, when her weeping eye<br>Saw Báli, on the litter lie,<br>Laid his dear head upon her lap,<br>And wailed aloud her dire mishap;<br>“O mighty Vánar, lord and king,<br>To whose fond breast I loved to cling,<br>Of goodly arms, wise, brave, and bold,<br>Rise, look upon me as of old.<br>Rise up, my sovereign, dost thou see<br>A crowd of subjects weep for thee?<br>Still o’er thy face, though breath has fled,<br>The joyous light of life is spread:<br>Thus around the sun, although he set,<br>A crimson glory lingers yet.<br>Death clad in Ráma’s form to-day<br>Hast dragged thee from the world away.<br>One shaft from his tremendous bow<br>Dooms us to widowhood and woe.<br>Hast thou, O Vánar King, no eyes<br>Thy weeping wives to recognize,<br>Who for the length of way unmeet<br>Have followed thee with weary feet?<br>Yet every moon-faced beauty here<br>By thee, O King was counted dear.<br>Lord of the Vánar race, hast thou<br>No eyes to see Sugríva now?<br>About thee stands in mournful mood<br>A sore-afflicted multitude,<br>And Tára and thy lords of state<br>Around their monarch weep and wait.<br>Arise my lord, with gentle speech,<br>As was thy wont, dismissing each,<br>Then in the forest will we play<br>And love shall make our spirits gay.”<br><br>  The Vánar dames raised Tárá, drowned<br>In floods of sorrow, from the ground;<br>And Angad with Sugríva’s aid,<br>O’erwhelmed with anguish and dismayed,<br>Weeping for his departed sire,<br>Placed Báli’s body on the pyre:<br>Then lit the flame, and round the dead<br>Passed slowly with a mourner’s tread.<br>Thus with full rites the funeral train<br>Performed the service for the slain,<br>Then sought the flowing stream and made<br>Libations to the parted shade.<br>There, setting Angad first in place,<br>The chieftains of the Vánar race,<br>With Tárá and Sugríva, shed<br>The water that delights the dead.
