                            “Ráma,” he cried, “a prince whose sway<br>All peoples of the earth obey,<br>To Daṇḍak’s tangled forest came<br>With his brave brother and his dame.<br>From that dark shade of forest boughs<br>The giant Rávaṇ stole his spouse.<br>Our king Sugríva’s orders send<br>These Vánars forth to aid his friend,<br>That so the lady be restored<br>Uninjured to her sorrowing lord.<br>With Angad and the rest, this band<br>Has wandered through the southern land,<br>With careful search in every place<br>The lady and the fiend to trace.<br>We roamed the southern region o’er,<br>And stood upon the ocean’s shore.<br>By hunger pressed our strength gave way;<br>Beneath the spreading trees we lay,<br>And cried, worn out with toil and woe,<br>“No farther, comrades, can we go.”<br>Then as our sad eyes looked around<br>We spied an opening in the ground,<br>Where all was gloomy dark behind<br>The creeping plants that o’er it twined.<br>Forth trooping from the dark-recess<br>Came swans and mallards numberless,<br>With drops upon their shining wings<br>As newly bathed where water springs.<br>“On, comrades, to the cave,” I cried<br>And all within the portal hied.<br>Each clasping fast another’s hand<br>Far onward pressed the Vánar band;<br>And still, as thirst and hunger drove,<br>We traced the mazes of the grove.<br>Here thou with hospitable care<br>Hast fed us with the noblest fare,<br>Preserving us, about to die,<br>With this thy plentiful supply.<br>But how, O pious lady, say,<br>May we thy gracious boon repay?”<br><br>  He ceased: the ascetic dame replied:<br>“Well, Vánars, am I satisfied.<br>A life of holy works I lead,<br>And from your hands no service need.”<br>Then spake again the Vánar chief:<br>“We came to thee and found relief.<br>Now listen to a new distress,<br>And aid us, holy votaress.<br>Our wanderings in this vasty cave<br>Exhaust the time Sugríva gave.<br>Once more then, lady, grant release,<br>And let thy suppliants go in peace<br>Again upon their errand sped,<br>For King Sugríva’s ire we dread.<br>And the great task our sovereign set,<br>Alas, is unaccomplished yet.”<br><br>  Thus Hanumán their leader prayed,<br>And thus the dame her answer made:<br>“Scarce may the living find their way<br>Returning hence to light of day;<br>But I will free you through the might<br>Of penance, fast, and holy rite.<br>Close for a while your eyes, or ne’er<br>May you return to upper air.”<br>She ceased: the Vánars all obeyed;<br>Their fingers on their eyes they laid,<br>And, ere a moment’s time had fled,<br>Were through the mazy cavern led.<br>Again the gracious lady spoke,<br>And joy in every bosom woke:<br>“Lo, here again is Vindhya’s hill,<br>Whose valleys trees and creepers fill;<br>And, by the margin of the sea,<br>Praśravaṇ where you fain would be.”<br>With blessings then she bade adieu,<br>And swift within the cave withdrew.
