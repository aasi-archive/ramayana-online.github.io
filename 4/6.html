                            With joy that sprang from hope restored<br>To Ráma spake the Vánar lord:<br>“I know, by wise Hanúmán taught,<br>Why thou the lonely wood hast sought.<br>Where with thy brother Lakshmaṇ thou<br>Hast sojourned, bound by hermit vow;<br>Have heard how Sítá, Janak’s child,<br>Was stolen in the pathless wild,<br>How by a roving Rákshas she<br>Weeping was reft from him and thee;<br>How, bent on death, the giant slew<br>The vulture king, her guardian true,<br>And gave thy widowed breast to know<br>A solitary mourner’s woe.<br>But soon, dear Prince, thy heart shall be<br>From every trace of sorrow free;<br>For I thy darling will restore,<br>Lost like the prize of holy lore.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">With the Indians, as with the ancient Greeks, the throbbing of the

reversed.

“The text has [Sanskrit text] which signifies literally ‘the lost
vedic tradition.’ It seems that allusion is here made to the Vedas
submerged in the depth of the sea, but promptly recovered by Vishṇu
in one of his incarnations, as the brahmanic legend relates, with
which the orthodoxy of the Bráhmans intended perhaps to allude to
the prompt restoration and uninterrupted continuity of the ancient
vedic tradition.”

GORRESIO.

</span></span><br>And from her lips that sad voice came<br>Shrieking thine own and Lakshmaṇ’s name.<br>High on a hill she saw me stand<br>With comrades twain on either hand.<br>Her outer robe to earth she threw,<br>And with it sent her anklets too.<br>We saw the glittering tokens fall,<br>We found them there and kept them all.<br>These will I bring: perchance thine eyes<br>The treasured spoils will recognize.”<br><br>  He ceased: then Raghu’s son replied<br>To the glad tale, and eager cried:<br>“Bring them with all thy speed: delay<br>No more, dear friend, but haste away.”<br><br>  Thus Ráma spoke. Sugríva hied<br>Within the mountain’s caverned side,<br>Impelled by love that stirred each thought<br>The precious tokens quickly brought,<br>And said to Raghu’s son: Behold<br>This garment and these rings of gold.<br>In Ráma’s hand with friendly haste<br>The jewels and the robe he placed.<br>Then, like the moon by mist assailed,<br>The tear-dimmed eyes of Ráma failed;<br>That burst of woe unmanned his frame,<br>Woe sprung from passion for his dame,<br>And with his manly strength o’erthrown,<br>He fell and cried, Ah me! mine own!<br>Again, again close to his breast<br>The ornaments and robe he pressed,<br>While the quick pants that shook his frame<br>As from a furious serpent came.<br>On his dear brother standing nigh<br>He turned at length his piteous eye;<br>And, while his tears increasing ran,<br>In bitter wail he thus began:<br>“Look, brother, and behold once more<br>The ornaments and robe she wore,<br>Dropped while the giant bore away<br>In cruel arras his struggling prey,<br>Dropped in some quiet spot, I ween,<br>Where the young grass was soft and green;<br>For still untouched by spot or stain<br>Their former beauty all retain.”<br><br>  He spoke with many a tear and sigh,<br>And thus his brother made reply:<br>“The bracelets thou hast fondly shown,<br>And earrings, are to me unknown,<br>But by long service taught I greet<br>The anklets of her honoured feet.”<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Like the wife of a Nága or Serpent-God carried off by an eagle. The
enmity between the King of birds and the serpent is of very frequent
occurrence. It seems to be a modification of the strife between the
Vedic Indra and the Ahi, the serpent or drought-fiend; between
Apollôn and the Python, Adam and the Serpent.

</span></span><br><br>  Then to Sugríva Ráma, best<br>Of Raghu’s sons, these words addressed:<br><br>  “Say to what quarter of the sky<br>The cruel fiend was seen to fly,<br>Bearing afar my captured wife,<br>My darling dearer than my life.<br>Speak, Vánar King, that I may know<br>Where dwells the cause of all my woe;<br>The fiend for whose transgression all<br>The giants by this hand shall fall.<br>He who the Maithil lady stole<br>And kindled fury in my soul,<br>Has sought his fate in senseless pride<br>And opened Death’s dark portal wide.<br>Then tell me, Vánar lord, I pray,<br>  The dwelling of my foe,<br>And he, beneath this hand, to-day<br>  To Yáma’s halls shall go.”
