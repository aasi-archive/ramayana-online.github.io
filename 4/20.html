                            Again she bent her to the ground,<br>Her arms about her husband wound.<br>Sobbed on his breast, and sick and faint<br>With anguish poured her wild complaint:<br>“Brave in the charge of battle, boast<br>And glory of the Vánar host,<br>Why on the cold earth wilt thou lie<br>And give no answer when I cry?<br>Up, warrior, from thy lowly bed!<br>A meeter couch for thee is spread.<br>It ill beseems a glorious king<br>On the bare ground his limbs to fling.<br>Ah, surely must thy love be strong<br>For her whom thou hast governed long,<br>If thou, my hero, canst recline<br>On her cold breast forsaking mine.<br>Or, famed for justice through the land,<br>Thou on the road to heaven hast planned<br>Some city fairer far than this<br>To be thy new metropolis.<br>Are all our pleasures ended now,<br>With those delicious hours which thou<br>And I, dear lord, together spent<br>In woods that breathed the honey’s scent?<br>Whelmed in my sorrow’s boundless sea,<br>There is no joy, no hope, for me,<br>When my beloved lord, who led<br>The Vánars to the fight, is dead,<br>My widowed heart is stern and cold.<br>Or, at the sight mine eyes behold,<br>O’ermastered would it end this ache<br>And in a thousand fragments break.<br>Ah noble Vánar, doomed to pay<br>The penalty of all today—<br>Sugríva from his home expelled,<br>And Rumá<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Sugríva’s wife.
