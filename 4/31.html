                            Thus Ráma spoke, and Lakshmaṇ then<br>Made answer to the prince of men:<br>“Yea, if the Vánar, undeterred<br>By fear of vengeance, break his word,<br>Loss of his royal power ere long<br>Shall pay the traitor for the wrong.<br>Nor deem I him so void of sense<br>To brave the bitter consequence.<br>But if enslaved to joy he lie,<br>And scorn thy grace with blinded eye,<br>Then let him join his brother slain:<br>Unmeet were such a wretch to reign.<br>Quick rises, kindling in my breast,<br>The wrath that will not be repressed,<br>And bids me in my fury slay<br>The breaker of his faith to-day.<br>Let Báli’s son thy consort trace<br>With bravest chiefs of Vánar race.”<br><br>  Thus spoke the hero, and aglow<br>With rage of battle seized his bow.<br>But Ráma thus in gentler mood<br>With fitting words his speech renewed:<br>“No hero with a soul like thine<br>To paths of sin will e’er incline,<br>He who his angry heart can tame<br>Is worthiest of a hero’s name.<br>Not thine, my brother, be the part<br>So alien from the tender heart,<br>Nor let thy feet by wrath misled<br>Forsake the path they loved to tread.<br>From harsh and angry words abstain:<br>With gentle speech a hearing gain,<br>And tax Sugríva with the crime<br>Of failing faith and wasted time.”<br><br>  Then Lakshmaṇ, bravest of the brave,<br>Obeyed the hest that Ráma gave,<br>To whom devoting every thought<br>The Vánar’s royal town he sought.<br>As Mandar’s mountain heaves on high<br>His curved peak soaring to the sky,<br>So Lakshmaṇ showed, his dread bow bent<br>Like Indra’s<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The rainbow.

</span></span> in the firmament.<br>His brother’s wrath, his brother’s woe<br>Inflamed his soul to fiercest glow.<br>The tallest trees to earth were cast<br>As furious on his way he passed,<br>And where he stepped, so fiercely fleet,<br>The stones were shivered by his feet.<br>He reached Kishkindhá’s city deep<br>Embosomed where the hills were steep,<br>Where street and open square were lined<br>With legions of the Vánar kind.<br>Then, as his lips with fury swelled,<br>The lord of Raghu’s line beheld<br>A stream of Vánar chiefs outpoured<br>To do obeisance to their lord.<br>But when the mighty prince in view<br>Of the thick coming Vánars drew,<br>They turned them in amaze to seize<br>Crags of the rock and giant trees.<br>He saw, and fiercer waxed his ire,<br>As oil lends fury to the fire.<br>Scarce had the Vánar chieftains seen<br>That wrathful eye, that troubled mien<br>Fierce as the God’s who rules the dead,<br>When, turned in wild affright, they fled.<br>Speeding in breathless terror all<br>Sought King Sugríva’s council hall,<br>And there made known their tale of fear,<br>That Lakshmaṇ wild with rage, was near.<br>The king, untroubled by alarms,<br>Held Tárá in his amorous arms,<br>And in the distant bower with her<br>Heard not each clamorous messenger.<br>Then, summoned at the lords’ behest<br>Forth from the city portals pressed,<br>Each like some elephant or cloud,<br>The Vánars in a trembling crowd:<br>Fierce warriors all with massive jaws<br>And terrors of their tiger claws,<br>Some matched ten elephants, and some<br>A hundred’s strength could overcome.<br>Some chieftains, mightier than the rest,<br>Ten times a hundred’s force possessed.<br>With eyes of fury Lakshmaṇ viewed<br>The Vánars’ tree-armed multitude.<br>Thus garrisoned from side to side<br>The city walls assault defied.<br>Beyond the moat that girt the wall<br>Advanced the Vánar chiefs; and all<br>Upon the plain in firm brigade,<br>Impetuous warriors, stood arrayed.<br>Red at the sight flashed Lakshmaṇ’s eyes,<br>His bosom heaved tumultuous sighs,<br>And forth the fire of fury broke<br>Like flame that flashes through the smoke.<br>Like some fierce snake the hero stood:<br>His bow recalled the expanded hood,<br>And in his shaft-head bright and keen<br>The flickering of its tongue was seen:<br>And in his own all-conquering might<br>The venom of its deadly bite.<br>Prince Angad marked his angry look,<br>And every hope his heart forsook.<br>Then, his large eyes with fury red,<br>To Angad Lakshmaṇ turned and said:<br><br>  “Go tell the king that Lakshmaṇ waits<br>For audience at the city gates,<br>Whose heart, O tamer of thy foes,<br>Is heavy with his brother’s woes.<br>Bid him to Ráma’s word attend,<br>And ask if he will aid his friend.<br>Go, let the king my message learn:<br>Then hither with all speed return.”<br><br>  Prince Angad heard and wild with grief<br>Cried as he looked upon the chief:<br>“’Tis Lakshmaṇ’s self: impelled by ire<br>He seeks the city of my sire.”<br>At the fierce words and furious look<br>Of Raghu’s son he quailed and shook.<br>Back through the city gates he sped,<br>And, laden with the tale of dread,<br>Sought King Sugríva, filled his ears<br>And Rumá’s with his doubts and fears.<br>To Rumá and the king he bent,<br>And clasped their feet most reverent,<br>Clasped the dear feet of Tárá, too,<br>And told the startling tale anew.<br><br>  But King Sugríva’s ear was dulled,<br>By love and wine and languor lulled,<br>Nor did the words that Angad spake<br>The slumberer from his trance awake.<br>But soon as Raghu’s son came nigh<br>The startled Vánars raised a cry,<br>And strove to win his grace, while dread<br>Each anxious heart disquieted.<br>They saw, and, as they gathered round,<br>Rose from the mighty throng a sound<br>Like torrents when they downward dash,<br>Or thunder with the lightning’s flash.<br>The shouting of the Vánars broke<br>Sugríva’s slumber, and he woke:<br>Still with the wine his eyes were red,<br>His neck with flowers was garlanded.<br>Roused at the voice of Angad came<br>Two Vánar lords of rank and fame;<br>One Yaksha, one Prabháva hight,—<br>Wise counsellors of gain and right.<br>They came and raised their voices high,<br>And told that Raghu’s son was nigh:<br>“Two brothers steadfast in their truth,<br>Each glorious in the bloom of youth,<br>Worthy of rule, have left the skies,<br>And clothed their forms in men’s disguise.<br>One at thy gates, in warlike hands<br>Holding his mighty weapon, stands.<br>His message is the charioteer<br>That brings the eager envoy near,<br>Urged onward by his bold intent,<br>And by the hest of Ráma sent.”<br>The gathered Vánars saw and fled,<br>And raised aloud their cry of dread.<br>Son of Queen Tárá, Angad ran<br>To parley with the godlike man.<br>Still fiery-eyed with rage and hate<br>Stands Lakshmaṇ at the city gate,<br>And trembling Vánars scarce can fly<br>Scathed by the lightning of his eye.<br>“Go with thy son, thy kith and kin,<br>The favour of the prince to win,<br>And bow thy reverent head that so<br>His fiery wrath may cease to glow.<br>What righteous Ráma bids thee, do,<br>And to thy plighted word be true.”
