into Ráma’s mouth. Ráma with all solemn ceremony, has made a league
of alliance with Báli’s younger brother whom he regards as a dear
friend and almost as an equal, and now he winds up his reasons for
killing Báli by coolly saying: “Besides you are only a monkey, you
know, after all, and as such I have every right to kill you how,
when, and where I like.”

</span></span><br>But yet, O best of Vánars, know<br>That kings who rule the earth bestow<br>Fruit of pure life and virtuous deed,<br>And lofty duty’s hard-won meed.<br>Harm not thy lord the king: abstain<br>From act and word that cause him pain;<br>For kings are children of the skies<br>Who walk this earth in men’s disguise.<br>But thou, in duty’s claims untaught,<br>Thy breast with blinding passion fraught,<br>Assailest me who still have clung<br>To duty, with thy bitter tongue.”<br><br>  He ceased: and Báli sore distressed<br>The sovereign claims of law confessed,<br>And freed, o’erwhelmed with woe and shame,<br>The lord of Raghu’s race from blame.<br>Then, reverent palm to palm applied,<br>To Ráma thus the Vánar cried:<br>“True, best of men, is every word<br>That from thy lips these ears have heard,<br>It ill beseems a wretch like me<br>To bandy empty words with thee.<br>Forgive the angry taunts that broke<br>From my wild bosom as I spoke.<br>And lay not to my charge, O King,<br>My mad reproaches’ idle sting.<br>Thou, in the truth by trial trained,<br>Best knowledge of the right hast gained:<br>And layest, just and pure within,<br>The meetest penalty on sin.<br>Through every bond of law I burst,<br>The boldest sinner and the worst.<br>O let thy right-instructing speech<br>Console my heart and wisely teach.”<br><br>  Like some sad elephant who stands<br>Fast sinking in the treacherous sands,<br>Thus Báli raised despairing eyes;<br>Then spake again with sobs and sighs:<br><br>  “Not for myself, O King, I grieve,<br>For Tárá or the friends I leave,<br>As for sweet Angad, my dear son,<br>My noble, only little one.<br>For, nursed in luxury and bliss,<br>His father he will mourn and miss,<br>And like a stream whose fount is dry<br>Will waste away and sink and die,—<br>My own dear child, my only boy,<br>His mother Tárá’s hope and joy.<br>Spare him, O son of Raghu, spare<br>The child entrusted to thy care.<br>My Angad and Sugríva treat<br>E’en as thy heart considers meet,<br>For thou, O chief of men, art strong<br>To guard the right and punish wrong.<br>O, if thou wilt thine ear incline<br>To hear these dying words of mine,<br>He and Sugríva will to thee<br>As Bharat and as Lakshmaṇ be.<br>Let not my Tárá, left forlorn,<br>Weep for Sugríva’s wrathful scorn;<br>Nor let him, for her lord’s offence,<br>Condemn her faithful innocence.<br>And well and wisely may he reign<br>If thy dear grace his power sustain:<br>If, following thee his friend and guide,<br>He turn not from thy hest aside:<br>Thus may he reign with glory, nay<br>Thus to the skies will win his way.<br>Though stayed by Tárá’s fond recall,<br>By thy dear hand I longed to fall.<br>Against my brother rushed and fought,<br>And gained the death I long have sought.”<br><br>  Then Ráma thus the prince consoled<br>From whose clear eyes the mists were rolled:<br>“Grieve not for those thou leavest thus,<br>Nor tremble for thyself or us,<br>For we will deal with thine and thee<br>As duty and the laws decree.<br>He who exacts and he who pays,<br>Is justly slain or justly slays,<br>Shall in the life to come have bliss;<br>For each has done his task in this.<br>Thou, wandering from the right, art made<br>Pure by the forfeit thou hast paid.<br>Thy weight of sins is cast aside,<br>And duty’s claim is satisfied.<br>Then grieve no more, O Prince, but clear<br>Thy bosom from all doubt and fear,<br>For fate, inexorably stern,<br>Thou hast no power to move or turn.<br>Thy princely Angad still will share<br>My tender love, Sugríva’s care;<br>And to thy offspring shall be shown<br>Affection that shall match thine own.”
