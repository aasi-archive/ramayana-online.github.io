                            There breathing still with slow faint sighs<br>Lay Báli on the ground: his eyes,<br>Damp with the tears of death, he raised,<br>On conquering Sugríva gazed,<br>And then in clearest speech expressed<br>The tender feelings of his breast:<br>“Not to my charge, Sugríva, lay<br>Thine injuries avenged to-day;<br>But rather blame resistless Fate<br>That urged me on infuriate.<br>Fate ne’er agreed our lives to bless<br>With simultaneous happiness:<br>To dwell like brothers side by side<br>In tender love was still denied.<br>The Vánars’ realm is thine to-day:<br>Begin, O King, thy rightful sway;<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Angad himself, being too young to govern, would be Yuvarája or

</span></span><br>All angry thoughts were stayed and stilled<br>And kindly love his bosom filled.<br>His brother’s word the chief obeyed<br>And took the chain as Báli prayed.<br>On little Angad standing nigh<br>The dying hero fixed his eye,<br>And, ready from this world to part,<br>Spoke the fond utterance of his heart:<br><br>  “Let time and place thy thoughts employ:<br>In woe be strong, be meek in joy.<br>Accept both pain and pleasure, still<br>Obedient to Sugríva’s will.<br>Thou hast, my darling, from the first<br>With tender care been softly nursed;<br>But harder days, if thou wouldst win<br>Sugríva’s love, must now begin.<br>To those who hate him ne’er incline,<br>Nor count his foe a friend of thine.<br>In all thy thoughts his welfare seek,<br>Obedient, lowly, faithful, meek.<br>Let no rash suit his bosom pain,<br>Nor yet from due requests abstain.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Or the passage may be interpreted: “Be neither too obsequious or
