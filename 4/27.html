                            But when the solemn rite was o’er,<br>And bold Sugríva reigned once more,<br>The sons of Raghu sought the hill,<br>Praśravaṇ of the rushing rill,<br>Where roamed the tiger and the deer,<br>And lions raised their voice of fear;<br>Thick set with trees of every kind,<br>With trailing shrubs and plants entwined;<br>Home of the ape and monkey, lair<br>Of mountain cat and pard and bear.<br>In cloudy gloom against the sky<br>The sanctifying hills rose high.<br>Pierced in their crest, a spacious cave<br>To Raghu’s sons a shelter gave.<br>Then Ráma, pure from every crime,<br>In words well suited to the time<br>To Lakshmaṇ spake, whose faithful zeal<br>Watched humbly for his brother’s weal:<br>“I love this spacious cavern where<br>There breathes a fresh and pleasant air.<br>Brave brother, let us here remain<br>Throughout the season of the rain.<br>For in mine eyes this mountain crest<br>Is above all, the loveliest.<br>Where copper-hued and black and white<br>Show the huge blocks that face the height;<br>Where gleams the shine of varied ore,<br>Where dark clouds hang and torrents roar;<br>Where waving woods are fair to see,<br>And creepers climb from tree to tree;<br>Where the gay peacock’s voice is shrill,<br>And sweet birds carol on the hill;<br>Where odorous breath is wafted far<br>From Jessamine and Sinduvár;<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Vitex Negundo.

</span></span><br>And opening flowers of every hue<br>Give wondrous beauty to the view.<br>See, too, this pleasant water near<br>Our cavern home is fresh and clear;<br>And lilies gay with flower and bud<br>Are glorious on the lovely flood.<br>This cave that fares north and east<br>Will shelter us till rain has ceased;<br>And towering hills that rise behind<br>Will screen us from the furious wind.<br>Close by the cavern’s portal lies<br>And level stone of ample size<br>And sable hue, a mighty block<br>Long severed from the parent rock.<br>Now let thine eye bent northward rest<br>A while upon that mountain crest,<br>High as a cloud that brings the rain,<br>And dark as iron rent in twain.<br>Look southward, brother, now and view<br>A cloudy pile of paler hue<br>Like Mount Kailása’s topmost height<br>Where ores of every tint are bright.<br>See, Lakshman, see before our cave<br>That clear brook eastward roll its wave<br>As though ’twere Gangá’s infant rill<br>Down streaming from the three-peaked hill.<br>See, by the water’s gentle flow<br>Aśoka, sál, and sandal grow.<br>And every lovely tree most fair<br>With leaf and bud and flower is there.<br>See there, beneath the bending trees<br>That fringe her bank, the river flees,<br>Clothed with their beauty like a maid<br>In all her robes and gems arrayed,<br>While from the sedgy banks are heard<br>The soft notes of each amorous bird.<br>O see what lovely islets stud<br>Like gems the bosom of the flood,<br>And sárases and wild swans crowd<br>About her till she laughs aloud.<br>See, lotus blooms the brook o’erspread,<br>Some tender blue, some dazzling red,<br>And opening lilies white as snow<br>Their buds in rich profusion show.<br>There rings the joyous peacock’s scream,<br>There stands the curlew by the stream,<br>And holy hermits love to throng<br>Where the sweet waters speed along.<br>Ranged on the grassy margin shine<br>Gay sandal trees in glittering line,<br>And all the wondrous verdure seems<br>The offspring of creative dreams.<br>O conquering Prince, there cannot be<br>A lovelier place than this we see.<br>Here sheltered on the beauteous height<br>Our days will pass in calm delight.<br>Nor is Kishkindhá’s city, gay<br>With grove and garden, far away.<br>Thence will the breeze of evening bring<br>Sweet music as the minstrels sing;<br>And, when the Vánars dance, will come<br>The sound of tabour and of drum.<br>Again to spouse and realm restored,<br>Girt by his friends, the Vánar lord<br>Great glory has acquired; and how<br>Can he be less than happy now?”<br><br>  This said, the son of Raghu made<br>His dwelling in that pleasant shade<br>Upon the mountain’s shelving side<br>That sweetly all his wants supplied.<br>But still the hero’s troubled mind<br>No comfort in his woe could find,<br>Yet mourning for his stolen wife<br>Dearer to Ráma than his life,<br>Chief when he saw the Lord of Night<br>Rise slowly o’er the eastern height,<br>He tossed upon his leafy bed<br>With eyes by sleep unvisited.<br>Outwelled the tears in ceaseless flow,<br>And every sense was numbed by woe.<br>Each pang that pierced the mourner through<br>Smote Lakshmaṇ’s faithful bosom too,<br>Who, troubled for his brother’s sake,<br>With wisest words the prince bespake:<br>“Arise, my brother, and be strong:<br>Thy hero heart has mourned too long.<br>Thou knowest well that tears and sighs<br>Will mar the mightiest enterprise.<br>Thine was the soul that loved to dare:<br>To serve the Gods was still thy care;<br>And ne’er may sorrow’s sting subdue<br>A heart so resolute and true.<br>How canst thou hope to slay in fight<br>The giant cruel in his might?<br>Unwearied must the champion be<br>Who strives with such a foe as he.<br>Tear out this sorrow by the root;<br>Again be bold and resolute.<br>Arise, my brother, and subdue<br>The demon and his wicked crew.<br>Thou canst destroy the earth, her seas,<br>Her rooted hills and giant trees<br>Unseated by thy furious hand:<br>And shall one fiend thy power withstand?<br>Wait through this season of the rain<br>Till suns of autumn dry the plain,<br>Then shall thy giant foe, and all<br>His host and realm, before thee fall.<br>I wake thy valour that has slept<br>Amid the tears thine eyes have wept;<br>As drops of oil in worship raise<br>The dormant flame to sudden blaze.”<br><br>  The son of Raghu heard: he knew<br>His brother’s rede was wise and true;<br>And, honouring his friendly guide,<br>In gentle words he thus replied:<br>“Whate’er a hero firm and bold,<br>Devoted, true, and lofty-souled<br>Should speak by deep affection led,<br>Such are the words which thou hast said.<br>I cast away each pensive thought<br>That brings the noblest plans to naught,<br>And each uninjured power will strain<br>Until the purposed end we gain.<br>Thy prudent words will I obey,<br>And till the close of rain-time stay,<br>When King Sugríva will invite<br>To action, and the streams be bright.<br>The hero saved in hour of need<br>Repays the debt with friendly deed:<br>But hated by the good are they<br>Who take the boon and ne’er repay.”
