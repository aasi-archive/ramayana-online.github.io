                            They stood where trees of densest green<br>Wove round their forms a veiling screen.<br>O’er all the garden’s pleasant shade<br>The eyes of King Sugríva strayed,<br>And, as on grass and tree he gazed,<br>The fires of wrath within him blazed.<br>Then like a mighty cloud on high,<br>When roars the tempest through the sky,<br>Girt by his friends he thundered out<br>His dread sky-rending battle-shout<br>Like some proud lion in his gait,<br>Or as the sun begins his state,<br>Sugríva let his quick glance rest<br>On Ráma whom he thus addressed:<br>“There is the seat of Báli’s sway,<br>Where flags on wall and turret play,<br>Which mighty bands of Vánars hold,<br>Rich in all arms and store of gold.<br>Thy promise to thy mind recall<br>That Báli by thy hand shall fall.<br>As kindly fruits adorn the bough.<br>So give my hopes their harvest now.”<br><br>  In suppliant tone the Vánar prayed,<br>And Raghu’s son his answer made:<br>“By Lakshmaṇ’s hand this flowery twine<br>Was wound about thee for a sign.<br>The wreath of giant creeper throws<br>About thy form its brillant glows,<br>As though about the sun were set<br>The bright stars for a coronet.<br>One shaft of mine this day, dear friend,<br>Thy sorrow and thy fear shall end.<br>And, from the bowstring freed, shall be<br>Giver of freedom, King, to thee.<br>Then come, Sugríva, quickly show,<br>Where’er he lie, thy bitter foe;<br>And let my glance the wretch descry<br>Whose deeds, a brother’s name belie.<br>Yea, soon in dust and blood o’erthrown<br>Shall Báli fall and gasp and groan.<br>Once let this eye the foeman see,<br>Then, if he live to turn and flee,<br>Despise my puny strength, and shame<br>With foul opprobrium Ráma’s name.<br>Hast thou not seen his hand, O King,<br>Through seven tall trees one arrow wing?<br>Still in that strength securely trust,<br>And deem thy foeman in the dust.<br>In all my days, though surely tried<br>By grief and woe, I ne’er have lied;<br>And still by duty’s law restrained<br>Will ne’er with falsehood’s charge be stained.<br>Cast doubt away: the oath I sware<br>Its kindly fruit shall quickly bear,<br>As smiles the land with golden grain<br>By mercy of the Lord of rain.<br>Oh, warrior to the gate I defy<br>Thy foe with shout and battle-cry,<br>Till Báli with his chain of gold<br>Come speeding from his royal hold.<br>Proud hearts, with warlike fire aglow,<br>Brook not the challenge of a foe:<br>Each on his power and might relies,<br>And most before his ladies eyes.<br>King Báli loves the fray too well<br>To linger in his citadel,<br>And, when he hears thy battle-shout,<br>All wild for war will hasten out.”<br><br>  He spoke. Sugríva raised a cry<br>That shook and rent the echoing sky,<br>A shout so fierce and loud and dread<br>That stately bulls in terror fled,<br>Like dames who fly from threatened stain<br>In some ignoble monarch’s reign.<br>The deer in wild confusion ran<br>Like horses turned in battle’s van.<br>Down fell the birds, like Gods who fall<br>When merits fail,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Called respectively Gárhapatya, Áhavaniya, and Dakshiṇa, household,

</span></span> at that dread call.<br>So fiercely, boldened for the fray,<br>The offspring of the Lord of Day<br>Sent forth his furious shout as loud<br>As thunder from a labouring cloud,<br>Or, where the gale blows fresh and free,<br>The roaring of the troubled sea.
