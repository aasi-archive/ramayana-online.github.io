readers but for chanters and oral reciters, these<em>&nbsp;formulæ</em>, to meet
the same recurring case, exist by scores. Thus every woman in these
metrical romances who happens to be young, is described as ‘so
bright of ble,’ or complexion; always a man goes ‘the mountenance of
a mile’ before he overtakes or is overtaken. And so on through a
vast bead-roll of cases. In the same spirit Homer has his eternal
τον δ’αρ’ ὑποδρα ιδων, or τον δ’απαμειβομενος προσφη, &c.

To a reader of sensibility, such recurrences wear an air of
child-like simplicity, beautifully recalling the features of Homer’s
primitive age. But they would have appeared faults to all
commonplace critics in literary ages.”
