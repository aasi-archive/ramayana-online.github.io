                            But Ráma in the autumn night<br>Stood musing on the mountain height,<br>While grief and love that scorned control<br>Shook with wild storms the hero’s soul.<br>Clear was the sky, without a cloud<br>The glory of the moon to shroud.<br>And bright with purest silver shone<br>Each hill the soft beams looked upon.<br>He knew Sugríva’s heart was bent<br>On pleasure, gay and negligent.<br>He thought on Janak’s child forlorn<br>From his fond arms for ever torn.<br>He mourned occasion slipping by,<br>And faint with anguish heaved each sigh.<br>He sat where many a varied streak<br>Of rich ore marked the mountain peak.<br>He raised his eyes the sky to view,<br>And to his love his sad thoughts flew.<br>He heard the Sáras cry, and faint<br>With sorrow poured his love-born plaint:<br>“She, she who mocked the softest tone<br>Of wild birds’ voices with her own,—<br>Where strays she now, my love who played<br>So happy in our hermit shade?<br>How can my absent love behold<br>The bright trees with their flowers of gold,<br>And all their gleaming glory see<br>With eyes that vainly look for me?<br>How is it with my darling when<br>From the deep tangles of the glen<br>Float carols of each bird elate<br>With rapture singing to his mate?<br>In vain my weary glances rove<br>From lake to hill, from stream to grove:<br>I find no rapture in the scene,<br>And languish for my fawn-eyed queen.<br>Ah, does strong love with wild unrest,<br>Born of the autumn, stir her breast?<br>And does the gentle lady pine<br>Till her bright eyes shall look in mine?”<br><br>  Thus Raghu’s son in piteous tone,<br>O’erwhelmed with sorrow, made his moan.<br>E’en as the bird that drinks the rains<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Chátaka, Cuculus, Melanoleucus, is supposed to drink nothing but

</span></span><br>But in Sugríva’s sloth I see<br>No care for deeds of chivalry.<br>See, Lakshmaṇ, on each breezy height<br>A thousand autumn blooms are bright.<br>See how the wings of wild swans gleam<br>On every islet of the stream.<br>Four months of flood and rain are past:<br>A hundred years they seemed to last<br>To me whom toil and trouble tried,<br>My Sítá severed from my side.<br>She, gentlest woman, weak and young,<br>Still to her lord unwearied clung.<br>Still by the exile’s side she stood<br>In the wild ways of Daṇḍak wood,<br>Like a fond bird disconsolate<br>If parted from her darling mate.<br>Sugríva, lapped in soft repose,<br>Untouched by pity for my woes,<br>Scorns the poor exile, dispossessed,<br>By Rávaṇ’s mightier arm oppressed,<br>The wretch who comes to sue and pray<br>From his lost kingdom far away.<br>Hence falls on me the Vánar’s scorn,<br>A suitor friendless and forlorn.<br>The time is come: with heedless eye<br>He sees the hour of action fly,—<br>Unmindful, now his hopes succeed,<br>Of promise made in stress of need.<br>Go seek him sunk in bliss and sloth,<br>Forgetful of his royal oath,<br>And as mine envoy thus upbraid<br>The monarch for his help delayed:<br>“Vile is the wretch who will not pay<br>The favour of an earlier day,<br>Hope in the supplicant’s breast awakes,<br>And then his plighted promise breaks.<br>Noblest, mid all of women born,<br>Who keeps the words his lips have sworn,<br>Yea, if those words be good or ill,<br>Maintains his faith unbroken still.<br>The thankless who forget to aid<br>The friend who helped them when they prayed,<br>Dishonoured in their death shall lie,<br>And dogs shall pass their corpses by.<br>Sure thou wouldst see my strained arm hold<br>My bow of battle backed with gold,<br>Wouldst gaze upon its awful form<br>Like lightning flashing through the storm,<br>And hear the clanging bowstring loud<br>As thunder from a labouring cloud.”<br><br>  His valour and his strength I know:<br>But pleasure’s sway now sinks them low,<br>With thee, my brother, for ally<br>That strength and valour I defy.<br>He promised, when the rains should end,<br>The succour of his arm to lend.<br>Those months are past: he dares forget,<br>And, lapped in pleasure, slumbers yet.<br>No thought disturbs his careless breast<br>For us impatient and distressed,<br>And, while we sadly wait and pine,<br>Girt by his lords he quaffs the wine.<br>Go, brother, go, his palace seek,<br>And boldly to Sugríva speak,<br>Thus give the listless king to know<br>What waits him if my anger glow:<br>Still open, to the gloomy God,<br>Lies the sad path that Báli trod.<br>“Still to thy plighted word be true,<br>Lest thou, O King, that path pursue.<br>I launched the shaft I pointed well.<br>And Báli, only Báli, fell.<br>But, if from truth thou dare to stray,<br>Both thee and thine this hand shall slay.”<br>Thus be the Vánar king addressed,<br>Then add thyself what seems the best.”
