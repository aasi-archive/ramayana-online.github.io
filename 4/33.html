</span></span> Lakshmaṇ gazed:<br>Like clouds of paly hue they shone<br>With fragrant wreaths that hung thereon:<br>There wealth of jewels was enshrined,<br>And fairer gems of womankind.<br>There gleamed, of noble height and size,<br>Like Indra’s mansion in the skies,<br>Protected by a crystal fence<br>Of rock, the royal residence,<br>With roof and turret high and bright<br>Like Mount Kailása’s loftiest height.<br>There blooming trees, Mahendra’s gift,<br>High o’er the walls were seen to lift<br>Their golden fruited boughs, that made<br>With leaf and flower delicious shade.<br>He saw a band of Vánars wait,<br>Wielding their weapons, at the gate<br>Where golden portals flashed between<br>Celestial garlands red and green.<br>Within Sugríva’s fair abode<br>Unchecked the mighty hero strode,<br>As when the sun of autumn shrouds<br>His glory in a pile of clouds.<br>Through seven wide courts he quickly passed,<br>And reached the royal tower at last,<br>Where seats were set with couch and bed<br>Of gold and silver richly spread.<br>While the young chieftain’s feet drew near<br>The sound of music reached his ear,<br>As the soft breathings of the flute<br>Came blending with the voice and lute.<br>Then beauty showed her youth and grace<br>And varied charm of form and face:<br>Soft bright-eyed creatures, fair and young,—<br>Gay garlands round their necks were hung,<br>And greater charms to each were lent<br>By richest dress and ornament.<br>He saw the calm attendants wait<br>About their lord in careless state,<br>Heard women’s girdles chime in sweet<br>Accordance with their tinkling feet.<br>He heard the anklet’s silvery sound,<br>He saw the calm that reigned around,<br>And o’er him, as he listened, came<br>A rush of rage, a flood of shame.<br>He drew his bowstring: with the clang<br>From ease to west the welkin rang:<br>Then in his modest mood withdrew<br>A little from the ladies’ view.<br>And sternly silent stood apart,<br>While wrath for Ráma filled his heart.<br>Sugríva knew the sounding string,<br>And at the call the Vánar king<br>Sprang swiftly from his golden seat,<br>And feared the coming prince to meet.<br>Then with cold lips that terror dried<br>To beauteous Tárá thus he cried:<br>“What cause of anger, O my spouse<br>Fair with the charm of lovely brows,<br>Sets Lakshmaṇ’s gentle breast on fire,<br>And brings him in unwonted ire?<br>Say, canst thou see, O faultless dame,<br>A cause to fill his soul with flame?<br>For there must be a reason when<br>Such fury stirs the king of men.<br>Reveal the sin, if sin of mine<br>Anger the lord of Raghu’s line.<br>Or go thyself, his rage subdue,<br>And with soft words his favour woo.<br>Soon as on thee his eyes are set<br>His heart this anger will forget,<br>For men like him of lofty mind<br>Are never stern with womankind.<br>First let thy gentle speech disarm<br>His fury, and his spirit charm,<br>And I, from fear of peril free,<br>The conqueror of his foes will see.”<br><br>  She heard: with faltering steps and slow,<br>With eyes that shone with trembling glow,<br>With gold-girt body gently bent<br>To meet the stranger prince she went.<br>When Lakshmaṇ saw the Vánar queen<br>With tranquil eyes and modest mien,<br>Before the dame he bent his head,<br>And anger, at her presence, fled.<br>Made bold by draughts of wine, and cheered<br>By Lakshmaṇ’s look no more she feared,<br>And in the trust his favour lent<br>She thus addressed him eloquent:<br>“Whence springs thy burning fury? say:<br>Who dares thy will to disobey?<br>Who checks the maddened flames that seize<br>On forests full of withered trees?”<br><br>  Then Lakshmaṇ spoke, her mind to ease,<br>His kind reply in words like these:<br><br>  “Thy lord his days in pleasure spends,<br>Heedless of duty and of friends,<br>Nor dost thou mark, though fondly true,<br>The evil path his steps pursue.<br>He cares not for affairs of state,<br>Nor us forlorn and desolate,<br>But sits a mere spectator still,<br>A sensual slave to pleasure’s will.<br>Four months were fixed, the time agreed<br>When he should help us in our need:<br>But, bound in toils of pleasure fast,<br>He sees not that the months are past.<br>Where beats the heart which draughts of wine<br>To virtue or to gain incline?<br>Hast thou not heard those draughts destroy<br>Virtue and gain and love and joy?<br>For those who, helped at need, refuse<br>Their aid in turn, their virtue lose:<br>And they who scorn a friend disdain<br>A treasure naught may buy again.<br>Thy lord has cast his friend away,<br>Nor feared from virtue’s path to stray,<br>If this be true, declare, O dame<br>Who knowest duty’s every claim,<br>What further work remains for us<br>Deceived and disappointed thus.”<br><br>  She listened, for his words were kind,<br>Where virtue showed with gain combined,<br>And thus in turn the prince addressed,<br>As hope was rising in his breast:<br>“No time, no cause of wrath I see<br>With those who live and honour thee:<br>And thou shouldst bear without offence<br>Thy servant’s fitful negligence.<br>I know the seasons glide away,<br>While Ráma maddens at delay<br>I know what deed our thanks has earned,<br>I know that grace should be returned.<br>But still I know, whate’er befall,<br>That conquering love is lord of all;<br>Know where Sugríva’s thoughts, possessed<br>By one absorbing passion, rest.<br>But he whom sensual joys debase<br>Heeds not the claim of time and place,<br>And sees not with his blinded sight<br>His duty or his gain aright.<br>O pardon him who loves me! spare<br>The Vánar caught in pleasure’s snare,<br>And once again let Ráma grace<br>With favour him who rules our race.<br>E’en royal saints, whose chief delight<br>Was penance and austerest rite,<br>At love’s commandment have unbent,<br>Beguiled by sweetest blandishment.<br>And know, Sugríva, roused at last,<br>The order to his lords has passed,<br>And, long by love and bliss delayed,<br>Wakes all on fire your hopes to aid.<br>A countless host his city fills,<br>New-gathered from a thousand hills:<br>Impetuous chiefs, who wear at need<br>Each varied form, his legions lead.<br>Come then, O hero, kept aloof<br>By modest awe, nor fear reproof:<br>A faithful friend untouched by blame<br>May look upon another’s dame.”<br><br>  He passed within, by Tárá pressed,<br>And by his own impatient breast,<br>Refulgent there in sunlike sheen<br>Sugríva on his throne was seen.<br>Gay garlands round his neck were twined,<br>And Rumá by her lord recline.
