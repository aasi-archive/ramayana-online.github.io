                            With longing love and woe oppressed<br>The Vánar chief he thus addressed:<br>And he, while sobs his utterance broke,<br>Raised up his reverent hands and spoke:<br><br>  “O Raghu’s son, I cannot tell<br>Where now that cruel fiend may dwell,<br>Declare his power and might, or trace<br>The author of his cursed race.<br>Still trust the promise that I make<br>And let thy breast no longer ache.<br>So will I toil, nor toil in vain,<br>That thou thy consort mayst regain.<br>So will I work with might and skill<br>That joy anew thy heart shall fill:<br>The valour of my soul display,<br>And Rávaṇ and his legions slay.<br>Awake, awake! unmanned no more<br>Recall the strength was thine of yore.<br>Beseems not men like thee to wear<br>A weak heart yielding to despair.<br>Like troubles, too, mine eyes have seen,<br>Lamenting for a long-lost queen;<br>But, by despair unconquered yet,<br>My strength of mind I ne’er forget.<br>Far more shouldst thou of lofty soul<br>Thy passion and thy tears control,<br>When I, of Vánar’s humbler strain,<br>Weep not for her in ceaseless pain.<br>Be firm, be patient, nor forget<br>The bounds the brave of heart have set<br>In loss, in woe, in strife, in fear,<br>When the dark hour of death is near.<br>Up! with thine own brave heart advise:<br>Not thus despond the firm and wise.<br>But he who gives his childish heart<br>To choose the coward’s weakling part,<br>Sinks, like a foundered vessel, deep<br>In waves of woe that o’er him sweep.<br>See, suppliant hand to hand I lay,<br>And, moved by faithful love, I pray.<br>Give way no more to grief and gloom,<br>But all thy native strength resume.<br>No joy on earth, I ween, have they<br>Who yield their souls to sorrow’s sway.<br>Their glory fades in slow decline:<br>’Tis not for thee to grieve and pine.<br>I do but hint with friendly speech<br>The wiser part I dare not teach.<br>This better path, dear friend, pursue,<br>And let not grief thy soul subdue.”<br><br>  Sugríva thus with gentle art<br>And sweet words soothed the mourner’s heart,<br>Who brushed off with his mantle’s hem<br>Tears from the eyes bedewed with them.<br>Sugríva’s words were not in vain,<br>And Ráma was himself again,<br>Around the king his arms he threw<br>And thus began his speech anew:<br><br>  “Whate’er a friend most wise and true,<br>Who counsels for the best, should do,<br>Whate’er his gentle part should be,<br>Has been performed, dear friend, by thee.<br>Taught by thy counsel, O my lord,<br>I feel my native strength restored.<br>A friend like thee is hard to gain,<br>Most rare in time of grief and pain.<br>Now strain thine utmost power to trace<br>The Maithil lady’s dwelling place,<br>And aid me in my search to find<br>Fierce Rávaṇ of the impious mind.<br>Trust thou, in turn, thy loyal friend,<br>And say what aid this arm can lend<br>To speed thy hopes, as fostering rain<br>Quickens in earth the scattered grain.<br>Deem not those words, that seemed to spring<br>From pride, are false, O Vánar King.<br>None from these lips has ever heard,<br>None e’er shall hear, one lying word.<br>Again I promise and declare,<br>Yea, by my truth, dear friend, I swear.”<br><br>  Then glad was King Sugríva’s breast,<br>And all his lords their joy confessed,<br>Stirred by sure hope of Ráma’s aid,<br>And promise which the prince had made.
