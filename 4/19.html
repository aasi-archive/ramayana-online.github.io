                            No answer gave the Vánar king<br>To Ráma’s prudent counselling.<br>Battered and bruised by tree and stone,<br>By Ráma’s arrow overthrown,<br>Fainting upon the ground he lay,<br>Gasping his troubled life away.<br><br>  But Tárá in the Vánar’s hall<br>Heard tidings of her husband’s fall;<br>Heard that a shaft from Ráma’s bow<br>Had laid the royal Báli low.<br>Her darling Angad by her side,<br>Distracted from her home she hied.<br>Then nigh the place of battle drew<br>The Vánars, Angad’s retinue.<br>They saw the bow-armed Ráma: dread<br>Fell on them, and they turned and fled.<br>Like helpless deer, their leaders slain,<br>So wildly fled the startled train.<br>But Tárá saw, and nearer pressed,<br>And thus the flying band addressed:<br>“O Vánars, ye who ever stand<br>About our king, a trusty band,<br>Where is the lion master? why<br>Forsake ye thus your lord and fly?<br>Say, lies he dead upon the plain,<br>A brother by a brother slain,<br>Or pierced by shafts from Ráma’s bow<br>That rain from far upon the foe?”<br><br>  Thus Tárá questioned, and was still:<br>Then, wearers of each shape at will,<br>The Vánars thus with one accord<br>Answered the Lady of their lord:<br>“Turn, Tárá turn, and half undone<br>Save Angad thy beloved son.<br>There Ráma stands in death’s disguise,<br>And conquered Báli faints and dies.<br>He by whose strong arm, thick and fast,<br>Uprooted trees and rocks were cast,<br>Lies smitten by a shaft that came<br>Resistless as the lightning flame.<br>When he, whose splendour once could vie<br>With Indra’s, regent of the sky,<br>Fell by that deadly arrow, all<br>The Vánars fled who marked his fall.<br>Let all our chiefs their succours bring,<br>And Angad be anointed king;<br>For all who come of Vánar race<br>Will serve him set in Báli’s place.<br>Or else our conquering foes to-day<br>Within our wall will force their way,<br>Polluting with their hostile feet<br>The chambers of thy loved retreat.<br>Great fear is on us, all and one.<br>Those who have wives and who have none,<br>They lust for power, are fierce and bold,<br>Or hate us for the strife of old.”<br><br>  She heard their speech as, sore afraid,<br>Arrested in their flight, they stayed,<br>And gave her answer as became<br>The spirit of so true a dame:<br>“Nay, what have I to do with pelf,<br>With son, with kingdom, or with self,<br>When he, my noble lord, who leads<br>The Vánars like a lion, bleeds?<br>His high-souled victor will I meet,<br>And throw me prostrate at his feet.”<br><br>  She hastened forth, her bosom rent<br>With anguish, weeping as she went,<br>And striking, mastered by her woes,<br>Her head and breast with frantic blows.<br>She hurried to the field and found<br>Her husband prostrate on the ground,<br>Who quelled the hostile Vánars’ might,<br>Whose bank was never turned in flight:<br>Whose arm a massy rock could throw<br>As Indra hurls his bolts below:<br>Fierce as the rushing tempest, loud<br>As thunder from a labouring cloud:<br>Whene’er he roared his voice of fear<br>Struck terror on the boldest ear:<br>Now slain, as, hungry for the prey,<br>A tiger might a lion slay:<br>Or when, his serpent foe to seek,<br>Suparṇa<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">A name of Garuḍa the king of birds, the great enemy of the Serpents.
