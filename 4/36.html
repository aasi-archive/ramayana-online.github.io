                            She ceased: and Lakshmaṇ gave assent,<br>Won by her gentle argument.<br>So Tárá’s pleading, just and mild,<br>His softening heart had reconciled.<br>His altered mood Sugríva saw,<br>And cast aside the fear and awe<br>Like raiment heavy with the rain<br>Which on his troubled soul had lain.<br>Then quickly to the ground he threw<br>His flowery garland, bright of hue,<br>Which round his royal neck he wore,<br>And, sobered, was himself once more.<br>Then turning to the princely man<br>In soothing words the king began:<br>“My glory, wealth, and royal sway<br>To other hands had passed away:<br>But Ráma to my rescue came,<br>And gave me back my power and fame.<br>O Lakshmaṇ, say, whose grateful heart<br>Could nurse the hope to pay in part,<br>By service of a life, the deed<br>Of Ráma sprung of heavenly seed?<br>His foeman Rávaṇ shall be slain,<br>And Sítá shall be his again.<br>The hero’s side I will not leave,<br>But he the conquest shall achieve.<br>What need of help has he who drew<br>His bow, and one great arrow flew<br>Through seven tall trees, a mountain rent,<br>And cleft the earth with force unspent?<br>What aid needs he who shook his bow,<br>And at the sound the earth below<br>With hill and wood and rooted rock<br>Quaked feverous with the thunder shock?<br>Yet all my legions will I bring,<br>And follow close the warrior king<br>Marching on his impetuous way<br>Fierce Rávaṇ and his hosts to slay.<br>If I be guilty of offence,<br>Careless through love or negligence,<br>Let him his loyal slave forgive;<br>For error cleaves to all who live.”<br><br>  Thus king Sugríva, good and brave,<br>In humble words his answer gave,<br>Softened was Lakshmaṇ’s angry mood<br>Who thus his friendly speech renewed:<br>“My brother, Vánar King, will see<br>A champion and a friend in thee.<br>So strong art thou, so brave and bold,<br>So pure in thought, so humble-souled,<br>That thou deservest well to reign<br>And all a monarch’s bliss to gain.<br>Lend thou my brother aid, and all<br>His foes beneath his arm will fall.<br>Full well the words thou speakest suit<br>A chieftain wise and resolute.<br>With grateful heart that loves the right,<br>And foot that never yields in fight.<br>O come, and my sad brother cheer<br>Who mourns the wife he holds so dear.<br>O pardon, friend, my harsh address,<br>And Ráma’s frantic bitterness.”
