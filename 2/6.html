                            Then Ráma bathed in order due,<br>His mind from worldly thoughts withdrew,<br>And with his large-eyed wife besought<br>Náráyaṇ, as a votary ought.<br>Upon his head the brimming cup<br>Of holy oil he lifted up,<br>Then placed within the kindled fire<br>The offering to that heavenly Sire,<br>And as he sipped the remnant prayed<br>To Him for blessing and for aid.<br>Then with still lips and tranquil mind<br>With his Videhan he reclined,<br>In Vishṇu’s chapel, on a bed<br>Where holy grass was duly spread,<br>While still the prince’s every thought<br>The God supreme, Náráyaṇ, sought.<br>One watch remained the night to close<br>When Ráma from his couch arose,<br>And bade the men and maids adorn<br>His palace for the solemn morn.<br>He heard the bards and heralds raise<br>Auspicious strains of joy and praise;<br>And breathed devout, with voice restrained,<br>The hymn for morning rites ordained;<br>Then, with his head in reverence bowed,<br>Praised Madhu’s conquering foe aloud,<br>And, in pure linen robes arrayed,<br>The priests to raise their voices prayed.<br>Obedient to the summons they<br>Proclaimed to all the festal day.<br>The Bráhmans’ voices, deep and sweet,<br>Resounded through the crowded street,<br>And echoed through Ayodhyá went<br>By many a loud-toned instrument.<br>Then all the people joyed to hear<br>That Ráma with his consort dear<br>Had fasted till the morning light<br>In preparation for the rite.<br>Swiftly the joyful tidings through<br>Ayodhyá’s crowded city flew,<br>And soon as dawn appeared, each man<br>To decorate the town began.<br>In all the temples bright and fair<br>As white clouds towering in the air,<br>In streets, and where the cross-ways met,<br>Where holy fig-trees had been set,<br>In open square, in sacred shade,<br>Where merchants’ shops their wealth displayed,<br>On all the mansions of the great,<br>And householders of wealth and state,<br>Where’er the people loved to meet,<br>Where’er a tree adorned the street,<br>Gay banners floated to the wind,<br>And ribands round the staves were twined.<br>Then clear the singers’ voices rang,<br>As, charming mind and ear, they sang.<br>Here players shone in bright attire,<br>There dancing women swelled the quire.<br>Each with his friend had much to say<br>Of Ráma’s consecration-day:<br>Yea, even children, as they played<br>At cottage doors beneath the shade.<br>The royal street with flowers was strown<br>Which loving hands in heaps had thrown,<br>And here and there rich incense lent<br>Its fragrance to the garland’s scent;<br>And all was fresh and fair and bright<br>In honour of the coming rite.<br>With careful foresight to illume<br>With borrowed blaze the midnight gloom,<br>The crowds erected here and there<br>Trees in each street gay lamps to bear.<br>The city thus from side to side<br>In festal guise was beautified.<br>The people of the town who longed<br>To view the rite together thronged,<br>And filling every court and square<br>Praised the good king in converse there:<br>“Our high-souled king!
