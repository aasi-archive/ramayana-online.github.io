                            Guha the king, acquainted well<br>With all that in the wood befell,<br>To Bharat the unequalled told<br>The tale of Lakshmaṇ mighty-souled:<br>“With many an earnest word I spake<br>To Lakshmaṇ as he stayed awake,<br>And with his bow and shaft in hand<br>To guard his brother kept his stand:<br>“Now sleep a little, Lakshmaṇ, see<br>This pleasant bed is strewn for thee:<br>Hereon thy weary body lay,<br>And strengthen thee with rest, I pray,<br>Inured to toil are men like these,<br>But thou hast aye been nursed in ease.<br>Rest, duteous-minded! I will keep<br>My watch while Ráma lies asleep:<br>For in the whole wide world is none<br>Dearer to me than Raghu’s son.<br>Harbour no doubt or jealous fear:<br>I speak the truth with heart sincere:<br>For from the grace which he has shown<br>Will glory on my name be thrown:<br>Great store of merit shall I gain,<br>And duteous, form no wish in vain.<br>Let me enforced by many a row<br>Of followers, armed with shaft and bow<br>For well-loved Ráma’s weal provide<br>Who lies asleep by Sítá’s side.<br>For through this wood I often go,<br>And all its shades conceal I know:<br>And we with conquering arms can meet<br>A four-fold host arrayed complete.”<br>“With words like these I spoke, designed<br>To move the high-souled Bharat’s mind,<br>But he upon his duty bent,<br>Plied his persuasive argument:<br>“O, how can slumber close mine eyes<br>When lowly couched with Sítá lies<br>The royal Ráma? can I give<br>My heart to joy, or even live?<br>He whom no mighty demon, no,<br>Nor heavenly God can overthrow,<br>See, Guha, how he lies, alas,<br>With Sítá couched on gathered grass.<br>By varied labours, long, severe,<br>By many a prayer and rite austere,<br>He, Daśaratha’s cherished son,<br>By Fortune stamped, from Heaven was won.<br>Now as his son is forced to fly,<br>The king ere long will surely die:<br>Reft of his guardian hand, forlorn<br>In widowed grief this land will mourn.<br>E’en now perhaps, with toil o’erspent,<br>The women cease their loud lament,<br>And cries of woe no longer ring<br>Throughout the palace of the king.<br>But ah for sad Kauśalyá! how<br>Fare she and mine own mother now?<br>How fares the king? this night, I think,<br>Some of the three in death will sink.<br>With hopes upon Śatrughna set<br>My mother may survive as yet,<br>But the sad queen will die who bore<br>The hero, for her grief is sore.<br>His cherished wish that would have made<br>Dear Ráma king, so long delayed,<br>“Too late! too late!” the king will cry,<br>And conquered by his misery die.<br>When Fate has brought the mournful day<br>Which sees my father pass away,<br>How happy in their lives are they<br>Allowed his funeral rites to pay.<br>Our exile o’er, with him who ne’er<br>Turns from the oath his lips may swear,<br>May we returning safe and well<br>gain in fair Ayodhyá dwell.”<br>Thus Bharat stood with many a sigh<br>Lamenting, and the night went by.<br>Soon as the morning light shone fair<br>In votive coils both bound their hair.<br>And then I sent them safely o’er<br>And left them on the farther shore.<br>With Sítá then they onward passed,<br>Their coats of bark about them cast,<br>  Their locks like hermits’ bound,<br>The mighty tamers of the foe,<br>Each with his arrows and his bow,<br>  Went over the rugged ground,<br>Proud in their strength and undeterred<br>Like elephants that lead the herd,<br>  And gazing oft around.”
