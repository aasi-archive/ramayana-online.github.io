</span></span><br>The queen, triumphant in the power<br>Won by her beauty’s fatal dower,<br>Still terrible and unsubdued,<br>Her dire demand again renewed:<br>“Great Monarch, ’twas thy boast till now<br>To love the truth and keep the vow;<br>Then wherefore would thy lips refuse<br>The promised boon ’tis mine to choose?”<br><br>  King Daśaratha, thus addressed,<br>With anger raging in his breast,<br>Sank for a while beneath the pain,<br>Then to Kaikeyí spoke again:<br>“Childless so long, at length I won,<br>With mighty toil, from Heaven a son,<br>Ráma, the mighty-armed; and how<br>Shall I desert my darling now?<br>A scholar wise, a hero bold,<br>Of patient mood, with wrath controlled,<br>How can I bid my Ráma fly,<br>My darling of the lotus eye?<br>In heaven itself I scarce could bear,<br>When asking of my Ráma there,<br>To hear the Gods his griefs declare,<br>And O, that death would take me hence<br>Before I wrong his innocence!”<br><br>  As thus the monarch wept and wailed,<br>And maddening grief his heart assailed,<br>The sun had sought his resting-place,<br>And night was closing round apace.<br>But yet the moon-crowned night could bring<br>No comfort to the wretched king.<br>As still he mourned with burning sighs<br>And fixed his gaze upon the skies:<br>“O Night whom starry fires adorn,<br>I long not for the coming morn.<br>Be kind and show some mercy: see,<br>My suppliant hands are raised to thee.<br>Nay, rather fly with swifter pace;<br>No longer would I see the face<br>Of Queen Kaikeyí, cruel, dread,<br>Who brings this woe upon mine head.”<br>Again with suppliant hands he tried<br>To move the queen, and wept and sighed:<br>“To me, unhappy me, inclined<br>To good, sweet dame, thou shouldst be kind;<br>Whose life is well-nigh fled, who cling<br>To thee for succour, me thy king.<br>This, only this, is all my claim:<br>Have mercy, O my lovely dame.<br>None else have I to take my part,<br>Have mercy: thou art good at heart.<br>Hear, lady of the soft black eye,<br>And win a name that ne’er shall die:<br>Let Ráma rule this glorious land,<br>The gift of thine imperial hand.<br>O lady of the dainty waist,<br>With eyes and lips of beauty graced,<br>Please Ráma, me, each saintly priest,<br>Bharat, and all from chief to least.”<br>  She heard his wild and mournful cry,<br>    She saw the tears his speech that broke,<br>Saw her good husband’s reddened eye,<br>  But, cruel still, no word she spoke.<br>His eyes upon her face he bent,<br>  And sought for mercy, but in vain:<br>She claimed his darling’s banishment,<br>  He swooned upon the ground again.
