                            It chanced a slave-born handmaid, bred<br>With Queen Kaikeyí, fancy-led,<br>Mounted the stair and stood upon<br>The terrace like the moon that shone.<br>Thence Manthará at ease surveyed<br>Ayodhyá to her eyes displayed,<br>Where water cooled the royal street,<br>Where heaps of flowers were fresh and sweet,<br>And costly flags and pennons hung<br>On roof and tower their shadow flung;<br>With covered ways prepared in haste,<br>And many an awning newly placed;<br>With sandal-scented streams bedewed,<br>Thronged by a new bathed multitude:<br>Whose streets were full of Bráhman bands<br>With wreaths and sweetmeats in their hands.<br>Loud instruments their music raised,<br>And through the town, where’er she gazed,<br>The doors of temples glittered white,<br>And the maid marvelled at the sight.<br><br>  Of Ráma’s nurse who, standing by,<br>Gazed with a joy-expanded eye,<br>In robes of purest white attired,<br>The wondering damsel thus inquired:<br><br>  “Does Ráma’s mother give away<br>Rich largess to the crowds to-day,<br>On some dear object fondly bent,<br>Or blest with measureless content?<br>What mean these signs of rare delight<br>On every side that meet my sight?<br>Say, will the king with joy elate<br>Some happy triumph celebrate?”<br><br>  The nurse, with transport uncontrolled,<br>Her glad tale to the hump-back told:<br>“Our lord the king to-morrow morn<br>Will consecrate his eldest-born,<br>And raise, in Pushya’s favouring hour,<br>Prince Ráma to the royal power.”<br>As thus the nurse her tidings spoke,<br>Rage in the hump-back’s breast awoke.<br>Down from the terrace, like the head<br>Of high Kailása’s hill, she sped.<br>Sin in her thoughts, her soul aflame,<br>Where Queen Kaikeyí slept, she came:<br>“Why sleepest thou?” she cried, “arise,<br>Peril is near, unclose thine eyes.<br>Ah, heedless Queen, too blind to know<br>What floods of sin above thee flow!<br>Thy boasts of love and grace are o’er:<br>Thine is the show and nothing more.<br>His favour is an empty cheat,<br>A torrent dried by summer’s heat.”<br><br>  Thus by the artful maid addressed<br>In cruel words from raging breast,<br>The queen, sore troubled, spoke in turn;<br>“What evil news have I to learn?<br>That mournful eye, that altered cheek<br>Of sudden woe or danger speak.”<br><br>  Such were the words Kaikeyí said:<br>Then Manthará, her eyeballs red<br>With fury, skilled with treacherous art<br>To grieve yet more her lady’s heart,<br>From Ráma, in her wicked hate,<br>Kaikeyí’s love to alienate,<br>Upon her evil purpose bent<br>Began again most eloquent:<br>“Peril awaits thee swift and sure,<br>And utter woe defying cure;<br>King Daśaratha will create<br>Prince Ráma Heir Associate.<br>Plunged in the depths of wild despair,<br>My soul a prey to pain and care,<br>As though the flames consumed me, zeal<br>Has brought me for my lady’s weal,<br>Thy grief, my Queen, is grief to me:<br>Thy gain my greatest gain would be.<br>Proud daughter of a princely line,<br>The rights of consort queen are thine.<br>How art thou, born of royal race,<br>Blind to the crimes that kings debase?<br>Thy lord is gracious, to deceive,<br>And flatters, but thy soul to grieve,<br>While thy pure heart that thinks no sin<br>Knows not the snares that hem thee in.<br>Thy husband’s lips on thee bestow<br>Soft soothing word, an empty show:<br>The wealth, the substance, and the power<br>This day will be Kauśalyá’s dower.<br>With crafty soul thy child he sends<br>To dwell among thy distant friends,<br>And, every rival far from sight,<br>To Ráma gives the power and might.<br>Ah me! for thou, unhappy dame,<br>Deluded by a husband’s name,<br>With more than mother’s love hast pressed<br>A serpent to thy heedless breast,<br>And cherished him who works thee woe,<br>No husband but a deadly foe.<br>For like a snake, unconscious Queen,<br>Or enemy who stabs unseen,<br>King Daśaratha all untrue<br>Has dealt with thee and Bharat too.<br>Ah, simple lady, long beguiled<br>By his soft words who falsely smiled!<br>Poor victim of the guileless breast,<br>A happier fate thou meritest.<br>For thee and thine destruction waits<br>When he Prince Ráma consecrates.<br>Up, lady, while there yet is time;<br>Preserve thyself, prevent the crime.<br>Up, from thy careless ease, and free<br>Thyself, O Queen, thy son, and me!”<br><br>  Delighted at the words she said,<br>Kaikeyí lifted from the bed,<br>Like autumn’s moon, her radiant head,<br>And joyous at the tidings gave<br>A jewel to the hump-back slave;<br>And as she gave the precious toy<br>She cried in her exceeding joy:<br>“Take this, dear maiden, for thy news<br>Most grateful to mine ear, and choose<br>What grace beside most fitly may<br>The welcome messenger repay.<br>I joy that Ráma gains the throne:<br>Kauśalyá’s son is as mine own.”
