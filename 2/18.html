                            With hopeless eye and pallid mien<br>There sat the monarch with the queen.<br>His father’s feet with reverence due<br>He clasped, and touched Kaikeyí’s too.<br>The king, with eyes still brimming o’er,<br>Cried Ráma! and could do no more.<br>His voice was choked, his eye was dim,<br>He could not speak or look on him.<br>Then sudden fear made Ráma shake<br>As though his foot had roused a snake,<br>Soon as his eyes had seen the change<br>So mournful, terrible, and strange.<br>For there his reason well-nigh fled,<br>Sighing, with soul disquieted,<br>  To torturing pangs a prey,<br>Dismayed, despairing, and distraught,<br>In a fierce whirl of wildering thought<br>  The hapless monarch lay,<br>Like Ocean wave-engarlanded<br>Storm-driven from his tranquil bed,<br>  The Sun-God in eclipse,<br>Or like a holy seer, heart-stirred<br>With anguish, when a lying word<br>  Has passed his heedless lips.<br>The sight of his dear father, pained<br>With woe and misery unexplained<br>  Filled Ráma with unrest,<br>As Ocean’s pulses rise and swell<br>When the great moon he loves so well<br>  Shines full upon his breast.<br>So grieving for his father’s sake,<br>To his own heart the hero spake:<br>“Why will the king my sire to-day<br>No kindly word of greeting say?<br>At other times, though wroth he be,<br>His eyes grow calm that look on me.<br>Then why does anguish wring his brow<br>To see his well-beloved now?”<br>Sick and perplexed, distraught with woe,<br>To Queen Kaikeyí bowing low,<br>While pallor o’er his bright cheek spread,<br>With humble reverence he said:<br>“What have I done, unknown, amiss<br>To make my father wroth like this?<br>Declare it, O dear Queen, and win<br>His pardon for my heedless sin.<br>Why is the sire I ever find<br>Filled with all love to-day unkind?<br>With eyes cast down and pallid cheek<br>This day alone he will not speak.<br>Or lies he prostrate neath the blow<br>Of fierce disease or sudden woe?<br>For all our bliss is dashed with pain,<br>And joy unmixt is hard to gain.<br>Does stroke of evil fortune smite<br>Dear Bharat, charming to the sight,<br>Or on the brave Śatrughna fall,<br>Or consorts, for he loves them all?<br>Against his words when I rebel,<br>Or fail to please the monarch well,<br>When deeds of mine his soul offend,<br>That hour I pray my life may end.<br>How should a man to him who gave<br>His being and his life behave?<br>The sire to whom he owes his birth<br>Should be his deity on earth.<br>Hast thou, by pride and folly moved,<br>With bitter taunt the king reproved?<br>Has scorn of thine or cruel jest<br>To passion stirred his gentle breast?<br>Speak truly, Queen, that I may know<br>What cause has changed the monarch so.”<br><br>  Thus by the high-souled prince addressed,<br>Of Raghu’s sons the chief and best,<br>She cast all ruth and shame aside,<br>And bold with greedy words replied:<br>“Not wrath, O Ráma, stirs the king,<br>Nor misery stabs with sudden sting;<br>One thought that fills his soul has he,<br>But dares not speak for fear of thee.<br>Thou art so dear, his lips refrain<br>From words that might his darling pain.<br>But thou, as duty bids, must still<br>The promise of thy sire fulfil.<br>He who to me in days gone by<br>Vouchsafed a boon with honours high,<br>Dares now, a king, his word regret,<br>And caitiff-like disowns the debt.<br>The lord of men his promise gave<br>To grant the boon that I might crave,<br>And now a bridge would idly throw<br>When the dried stream has ceased to flow.<br>His faith the monarch must not break<br>In wrath, or e’en for thy dear sake.<br>From faith, as well the righteous know,<br>Our virtue and our merits flow.<br>Now, be they good or be they ill,<br>Do thou thy father’s words fulfil:<br>Swear that his promise shall not fail,<br>And I will tell thee all the tale.<br>Yes, Ráma, when I hear that thou<br>Hast bound thee by thy father’s vow,<br>Then, not till then, my lips shall speak,<br>Nor will he tell what boon I seek.”<br><br>  He heard, and with a troubled breast<br>This answer to the queen addressed:<br>“Ah me, dear lady, canst thou deem<br>That words like these thy lips beseem?<br>I, at the bidding of my sire,<br>Would cast my body to the fire,<br>A deadly draught of poison drink,<br>Or in the waves of ocean sink:<br>If he command, it shall be done,—<br>My father and my king in one.<br>Then speak and let me know the thing<br>So longed for by my lord the king.<br>It shall be done: let this suffice;<br>Ráma ne’er makes a promise twice.”<br><br>  He ended. To the princely youth<br>Who loved the right and spoke the truth,<br>Cruel, abominable came<br>The answer of the ruthless dame:<br>“When Gods and Titans fought of yore,<br>Transfixed with darts and bathed in gore<br>Two boons to me thy father gave<br>For the dear life ’twas mine to save.<br>Of him I claim the ancient debt,<br>That Bharat on the throne be set,<br>And thou, O Ráma, go this day<br>To Daṇḍak forest far away.<br>Now, Ráma, if thou wilt maintain<br>Thy father’s faith without a stain,<br>And thine own truth and honour clear,<br>Then, best of men, my bidding hear.<br>Do thou thy father’s word obey,<br>Nor from the pledge he gave me stray.<br>Thy life in Daṇḍak forest spend<br>Till nine long years and five shall end.<br>Upon my Bharat’s princely head<br>Let consecrating drops be shed,<br>With all the royal pomp for thee<br>Made ready by the king’s decree.<br>Seek Daṇḍak forest and resign<br>Rites that would make the empire thine,<br>For twice seven years of exile wear<br>The coat of bark and matted hair.<br>Then in thy stead let Bharat reign<br>Lord of his royal sire’s domain,<br>Rich in the fairest gems that shine,<br>Cars, elephants, and steeds, and kine.<br>The monarch mourns thy altered fate<br>And vails his brow compassionate:<br>Bowed down by bitter grief he lies<br>And dares not lift to thine his eyes.<br>Obey his word: be firm and brave,<br>And with great truth the monarch save.”<br>  While thus with cruel words she spoke,<br>    No grief the noble youth betrayed;<br>But forth the father’s anguish broke,<br>  At his dear Ráma’s lot dismayed.
