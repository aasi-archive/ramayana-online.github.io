                            Thus Ráma showed to Janak’s child<br>The varied beauties of the wild,<br>The hill, the brook and each fair spot,<br>Then turned to seek their leafy cot.<br>North of the mountain Ráma found<br>A cavern in the sloping ground,<br>Charming to view, its floor was strown<br>With many a mass of ore and stone,<br>In secret shadow far retired<br>Where gay birds sang with joy inspired,<br>And trees their graceful branches swayed<br>With loads of blossom downward weighed.<br>Soon as he saw the cave which took<br>Each living heart and chained the look,<br>Thus Ráma spoke to Sítá who<br>Gazed wondering on the silvan view:<br>“Does this fair cave beneath the height,<br>Videhan lady, charm thy sight?<br>Then let us resting here a while<br>The languor of the way beguile.<br>That block of stone so smooth and square<br>Was set for thee to rest on there,<br>And like a thriving Keśar tree<br>This flowery shrub o’ershadows thee.”<br>Thus Ráma spoke, and Janak’s child,<br>By nature ever soft and mild,<br>In tender words which love betrayed<br>Her answer to the hero made:<br>“O pride of Raghu’s children, still<br>My pleasure is to do thy will.<br>Enough for me thy wish to know:<br>Far hast thou wandered to and fro.”<br><br>  Thus Sítá spake in gentle tone,<br>And went obedient to the stone,<br>Of perfect face and faultless limb<br>Prepared to rest a while with him.<br>And Ráma, as she thus replied,<br>Turned to his spouse again and cried:<br>“Thou seest, love, this flowery shade<br>For silvan creatures’ pleasure made,<br>How the gum streams from trees and plants<br>Torn by the tusks of elephants!<br>Through all the forest clear and high<br>Resounds the shrill cicala’s cry.<br>Hark how the kite above us moans,<br>And calls her young in piteous tones;<br>So may my hapless mother be<br>Still mourning in her home for me.<br>There mounted on that lofty Sál<br>The loud Bhringráj<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">A fine bird with a strong, sweet note, and great imitative powers.

</span></span> repeats his call:<br>How sweetly now he tunes his throat<br>Responsive to the Koïl’s note.<br>Or else the bird that now has sung<br>May be himself the Koïl’s young,<br>Linked with such winning sweetness are<br>The notes he pours irregular.<br>See, round the blooming Mango clings<br>That creeper with her tender rings,<br>So in thy love, when none is near,<br>Thine arms are thrown round me, my dear.”<br><br>  Thus in his joy he cried; and she,<br>Sweet speaker, on her lover’s knee,<br>Of faultless limb and perfect face,<br>Grew closer to her lord’s embrace.<br>Reclining in her husband’s arms,<br>A goddess in her wealth of charms,<br>She filled his loving breast anew<br>With mighty joy that thrilled him through.<br>His finger on the rock he laid,<br>Which veins of sanguine ore displayed,<br>And painted o’er his darling’s eyes<br>The holy sign in mineral dyes.<br>Bright on her brow the metal lay<br>Like the young sun’s first gleaming ray,<br>And showed her in her beauty fair<br>As the soft light of morning’s air.<br>Then from the Keśar’s laden tree<br>He picked fair blossoms in his glee,<br>And as he decked each lovely tress,<br>His heart o’erflowed with happiness.<br>So resting on that rocky seat<br>A while they spent in pastime sweet,<br>Then onward neath the shady boughs<br>Went Ráma with his Maithil spouse.<br>She roaming in the forest shade<br>Where every kind of creature strayed<br>Observed a monkey wandering near,<br>And clung to Ráma’s arm in fear.<br>The hero Ráma fondly laced<br>His mighty arms around her waist,<br>Consoled his beauty in her dread,<br>And scared the Monkey till he fled.<br>That holy mark of sanguine ore<br>That gleamed on Sítá’s brow before,<br>Shone by that close embrace impressed<br>Upon the hero’s ample chest.<br>Then Sítá, when the beast who led<br>The monkey troop, afar had fled,<br>Laughed loudly in light-hearted glee<br>That mark on Ráma’s chest to see.<br>A clump of bright Aśokas fired<br>The forest in their bloom attired:<br>The restless blossoms as they gleamed<br>A host of threatening monkeys seemed.<br>Then Sítá thus to Ráma cried,<br>As longingly the flowers she eyed:<br>“Pride of thy race, now let us go<br>Where those Aśoka blossoms grow.”<br>He on his darling’s pleasure bent<br>With his fair goddess thither went<br>And roamed delighted through the wood<br>Where blossoming Aśokas stood,<br>As Śiva with Queen Umá roves<br>Through Himaván’s majestic groves.<br>Bright with purpureal glow the pair<br>Of happy lovers sported there,<br>And each upon the other set<br>A flower-inwoven coronet.<br>There many a crown and chain they wove<br>Of blooms from that Aśoka grove,<br>And in their graceful sport the two<br>Fresh beauty o’er the mountain threw.<br>The lover let his love survey<br>Each pleasant spot that round them lay,<br>Then turned they to their green retreat<br>Where all was garnished, gay, and neat.<br>By brotherly affection led,<br>Sumitrá’s son to meet them sped,<br>And showed the labours of the day<br>Done while his brother was away.<br>There lay ten black-deer duly slain<br>With arrows pure of poison stain,<br>Piled in a mighty heap to dry,<br>With many another carcass nigh.<br>And Lakshmaṇ’s brother saw, o’erjoyed,<br>The work that had his hands employed,<br>Then to his consort thus he cried:<br>“Now be the general gifts supplied.”<br>Then Sítá, fairest beauty, placed<br>The food for living things to taste,<br>And set before the brothers meat<br>And honey that the pair might eat.<br>They ate the meal her hands supplied,<br>Their lips with water purified:<br>Then Janak’s daughter sat at last<br>And duly made her own repast.<br>The other venison, to be dried,<br>Piled up in heaps was set aside,<br>And Ráma told his wife to stay<br>And drive the flocking crows away.<br>Her husband saw her much distressed<br>By one more bold than all the rest,<br>Whose wings where’er he chose could fly,<br>Now pierce the earth, now roam the sky.<br>Then Ráma laughed to see her stirred<br>To anger by the plaguing bird:<br>Proud of his love the beauteous dame<br>With burning rage was all aflame.<br>Now here, now there, again, again<br>She chased the crow, but all in vain,<br>Enraging her, so quick to strike<br>With beak and wing and claw alike:<br>Then how the proud lip quivered, how<br>The dark frown marked her angry brow!<br>When Ráma saw her cheek aglow<br>With passion, he rebuked the crow.<br>But bold in impudence the bird,<br>With no respect for Ráma’s word,<br>Fearless again at Sítá flew:<br>Then Ráma’s wrath to fury grew.<br>The hero of the mighty arm<br>Spoke o’er a shaft the mystic charm,<br>Laid the dire weapon on his bow<br>And launched it at the shameless crow.<br>The bird, empowered by Gods to spring<br>Through earth itself on rapid wing,<br>Through the three worlds in terror fled<br>Still followed by that arrow dread.<br>Where’er he flew, now here now there,<br>A cloud of weapons filled the air.<br>Back to the high-souled prince he fled<br>And bent at Ráma’s feet his head,<br>And then, as Sítá looked, began<br>His speech in accents of a man:<br>“O pardon, and for pity’s sake<br>Spare, Ráma, spare my life to take!<br>Where’er I turn, where’er I flee,<br>No shelter from this shaft I see.”<br><br>  The chieftain heard the crow entreat<br>Helpless and prostrate at his feet,<br>And while soft pity moved his breast,<br>With wisest speech the bird addressed:<br>“I took the troubled Sítá’s part,<br>And furious anger filled my heart.<br>Then on the string my arrow lay<br>Charmed with a spell thy life to slay.<br>Thou seekest now my feet, to crave<br>Forgiveness and thy life to save.<br>So shall thy prayer have due respect:<br>The suppliant I must still protect.<br>But ne’er in vain this dart may flee;<br>Yield for thy life a part of thee,<br>What portion of thy body, say,<br>Shall this mine arrow rend away?<br>Thus far, O bird, thus far alone<br>On thee my pity may be shown.<br>Forfeit a part thy life to buy:<br>’Tis better so to live than die.”<br>Thus Ráma spoke: the bird of air<br>Pondered his speech with anxious care,<br>And wisely deemed it good to give<br>One of his eyes that he might live.<br>To Raghu’s son he made reply:<br>“O Ráma, I will yield an eye.<br>So let me in thy grace confide<br>And live hereafter single-eyed.”<br>Then Ráma charged the shaft, and lo,<br>Full in the eye it smote the crow.<br>And the Videhan lady gazed<br>Upon the ruined eye amazed.<br>The crow to Ráma humbly bent,<br>Then where his fancy led he went.<br>Ráma with Lakshmaṇ by his side<br>With needful work was occupied.
