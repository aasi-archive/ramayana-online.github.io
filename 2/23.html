                            Thus Ráma to his brother said;<br>And Lakshmaṇ bent his drooping head.<br>In turns by grief and pride impelled,<br>A middle course of thought he held,<br>Then in a frown of anger, bent<br>His brows that chief most excellent,<br>And like a serpent in his hole,<br>Breathed fierce and fast in wrath of soul.<br>His threatening brows so darkly frowned,<br>His eyes so fiercely glanced around,<br>They made his glare, which none might brook,<br>Like some infuriate lion’s look.<br>Like some wild elephant, full oft<br>He raised and shook his hand<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Sanskrit word<em>&nbsp;hasta</em> signifies both<em>&nbsp;hand</em>, and the trunk of

</span></span> aloft.<br>Now turned his neck to left and right<br>Now bent, now raised its stately height.<br>Now in his rage that sword he felt<br>Which mangling wounds to foemen dealt,<br>With sidelong glance his brother eyed,<br>And thus in burning words replied:<br>“Thy rash resolve, thy eager haste,<br>Thy mighty fear, are all misplaced:<br>No room is here for duty’s claim,<br>No cause to dread the people’s blame.<br>Can one as brave as thou consent<br>To use a coward’s argument?<br>The glory of the Warrior race<br>With craven speech his lips debase?<br>Can one like thee so falsely speak,<br>Exalting Fate, confessed so weak?<br>Canst thou, undoubting still restrain?<br>Suspicions of those sinful twain?<br>Canst thou, most duteous, fail to know<br>Their hearts are set on duty’s show?<br>They with deceit have set their trains,<br>And now the fruit rewards their pains.<br>Had they not long ago agreed,<br>O Ráma, on this treacherous deed,<br>That promised boon, so long retained,<br>He erst had given and she had gained.<br>I cannot, O my brother, bear<br>To see another throned as heir<br>With rites which all our people hate:<br>Then, O, this passion tolerate.<br>This vaunted duty which can guide<br>Thy steps from wisdom’s path aside,<br>And change the counsel of thy breast,<br>O lofty-hearted, I detest.<br>Wilt thou, when power and might are thine,<br>Submit to this abhorred design?<br>Thy father’s impious hest fulfil,<br>That vassal of Kaikeyí’s will?<br>But if thou still wilt shut thine eyes,<br>Nor see the guile herein that lies,<br>My soul is sad, I deeply mourn,<br>And duty seems a thing to scorn.<br>Canst thou one moment think to please<br>This pair who live for love and ease,<br>And ’gainst thy peace, as foes, allied,<br>With tenderest names their hatred hide?<br>Now if thy judgment still refers<br>To Fate this plot of his and hers,<br>My mind herein can ne’er agree:<br>And O, in this be ruled by me.<br>Weak, void of manly pride are they<br>Who bend to Fate’s imputed sway:<br>The choicest souls, the nobly great<br>Disdain to bow their heads to Fate.<br>And he who dares his Fate control<br>With vigorous act and manly soul,<br>Though threatening Fate his hopes assail,<br>Unmoved through all need never quail.<br>This day mankind shall learn aright<br>The power of Fate and human might,<br>So shall the gulf that lies between<br>A man and Fate be clearly seen.<br>The might of Fate subdued by me<br>This hour the citizens shall see,<br>Who saw its intervention stay<br>Thy consecrating rites to-day.<br>My power shall turn this Fate aside,<br>That threatens, as, with furious stride,<br>An elephant who scorns to feel,<br>In rage unchecked, the driver’s steel.<br>Not the great Lords whose sleepless might<br>Protects the worlds, shall stay the rite<br>Though earth, hell, heaven combine their powers:<br>And shall we fear this sire of ours?<br>Then if their minds are idly bent<br>To doom thee, King, to banishment,<br>Through twice seven years of exile they<br>Shall in the lonely forest stay.<br>I will consume the hopes that fire<br>The queen Kaikeyí and our sire,<br>That to her son this check will bring<br>Advantage, making Bharat king.<br>The power of Fate will ne’er withstand<br>The might that arms my vigorous hand;<br>If danger and distress assail,<br>My fearless strength will still prevail.<br>A thousand circling years shall flee:<br>The forest then thy home shall be,<br>And thy good sons, succeeding, hold<br>The empire which their sire controlled.<br>The royal saints, of old who reigned,<br>For aged kings this rest ordained:<br>These to their sons their realm commit<br>That they, like sires, may cherish it.<br>O pious soul, if thou decline<br>The empire which is justly thine,<br>Lest, while the king distracted lies,<br>Disorder in the state should rise,<br>I,—or no mansion may I find<br>In worlds to hero souls assigned,—<br>The guardian of thy realm will be,<br>As the sea-bank protects the sea.<br>Then cast thine idle fears aside:<br>With prosperous rites be sanctified.<br>The lords of earth may strive in vain:<br>My power shall all their force restrain.<br>My pair of arms, my warrior’s bow<br>Are not for pride or empty show:<br>For no support these shafts were made;<br>And binding up ill suits my blade:<br>To pierce the foe with deadly breach—<br>This is the work of all and each.<br>But small, methinks the love I show<br>For him I count my mortal foe.<br>Soon as my trenchant steel is bare,<br>Flashing its lightning through the air,<br>I heed no foe, nor stand aghast<br>Though Indra’s self the levin cast.<br>Then shall the ways be hard to pass,<br>Where chariots lie in ruinous mass;<br>When elephant and man and steed<br>Crushed in the murderous onslaught bleed,<br>And legs and heads fall, heap on heap,<br>Beneath my sword’s tremendous sweep.<br>Struck by my keen brand’s trenchant blade,<br>Thine enemies shall fall dismayed,<br>Like towering mountains rent in twain,<br>Or lightning clouds that burst in rain.<br>When armed with brace and glove I stand,<br>And take my trusty bow in hand,<br>Who then shall vaunt his might? who dare<br>Count him a man to meet me there?<br>Then will I loose my shafts, and strike<br>Man, elephant, and steed alike:<br>At one shall many an arrow fly,<br>And many a foe with one shall die.<br>This day the world my power shall see,<br>That none in arms can rival me:<br>My strength the monarch shall abase,<br>And set thee, lord, in lordliest place.<br>These arms which breathe the sandal’s scent,<br>Which golden bracelets ornament,<br>These hands which precious gifts bestow,<br>Which guard the friend and smite the foe,<br>A nobler service shall assay,<br>And fight in Ráma’s cause to-day,<br>The robbers of thy rights to stay.<br>  Speak, brother, tell thy foeman’s name<br>    Whom I, in conquering strife,<br>  May strip of followers and fame,<br>    Of fortune, or of life.<br>  Say, how may all this sea-girt land<br>    Be brought to own thy sway:<br>  Thy faithful servant here I stand<br>    To listen and obey.”<br>  Then strove the bride of Raghu’s race<br>    Sad Lakshmaṇ’s heart to cheer,<br>  While slowly down the hero’s face,<br>    Unchecked, there rolled a tear.<br>  “The orders of my sire,” he cried,<br>    “My will shall ne’er oppose:<br>  I follow still, whate’er betide,<br>    The path which duty shows.”
