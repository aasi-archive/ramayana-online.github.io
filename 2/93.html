                            As through the woods its way pursued<br>That mighty bannered multitude,<br>Wild elephants in terror fled<br>With all the startled herds they led,<br>And bears and deer were seen on hill,<br>In forest glade, by every rill.<br>Wide as the sea from coast to coast,<br>The high-souled Bharat’s mighty host<br>Covered the earth as cloudy trains<br>Obscure the sky when fall the rains.<br>The stately elephants he led,<br>And countless steeds the land o’erspread,<br>So closely crowded that between<br>Their serried ranks no ground was seen.<br>Then when the host had travelled far,<br>And steeds were worn who drew the car,<br>The glorious Bharat thus addressed<br>Vaśishṭha, of his lords the best:<br>“The spot, methinks, we now behold<br>Of which the holy hermit told,<br>For, as his words described, I trace<br>Each several feature of the place:<br>Before us Chitrakúṭa shows,<br>Mandákiní beside us flows:<br>Afar umbrageous woods arise<br>Like darksome clouds that veil the skies.<br>Now tread these mountain-beasts of mine<br>On Chitrakúṭa’s fair incline.<br>The trees their rain of blossoms shed<br>On table-lands beneath them spread,<br>As from black clouds the floods descend<br>When the hot days of summer end.<br>Śatrughna, look, the mountain see<br>Where heavenly minstrels wander free,<br>And horses browse beneath the steep,<br>Countless as monsters in the deep.<br>Scared by my host the mountain deer<br>Starting with tempest speed appear<br>Like the long lines of cloud that fly<br>In autumn through the windy sky.<br>See, every warrior shows his head<br>With fragrant blooms engarlanded;<br>All look like southern soldiers who<br>Lift up their shields of azure hue.<br>This lonely wood beneath the hill,<br>That was so dark and drear and still,<br>Covered with men in endless streams<br>Now like Ayodhyá’s city seems.<br>The dust which countless hoofs excite<br>Obscures the sky and veils the light;<br>But see, swift winds those clouds dispel<br>As if they strove to please me well.<br>See, guided in their swift career<br>By many a skilful charioteer,<br>Those cars by fleetest coursers drawn<br>Race onward over glade and lawn.<br>Look, startled as the host comes near<br>The lovely peacocks fly in fear,<br>Gorgeous as if the fairest blooms<br>Of earth had glorified their plumes.<br>Look where the sheltering covert shows<br>The trooping deer, both bucks and does,<br>That occupy in countless herds<br>This mountain populous with birds.<br>Most lovely to my mind appears<br>This place which every charm endears:<br>Fair as the road where tread the Blest;<br>Here holy hermits take their rest.<br>Then let the army onward press<br>And duly search each green recess<br>For the two lion-lords, till we<br>Ráma once more and Lakshmaṇ see.”<br><br>  Thus Bharat spoke: and hero bands<br>Of men with weapons in their hands<br>Entered the tangled forest: then<br>A spire of smoke appeared in ken.<br>Soon as they saw the rising smoke<br>To Bharat they returned and spoke:<br>“No fire where men are not: ’tis clear<br>That Raghu’s sons are dwelling here.<br>Or if not here those heroes dwell<br>Whose mighty arms their foeman quell,<br>Still other hermits here must be<br>Like Ráma, true and good as he.”<br><br>  His ears attentive Bharat lent<br>To their resistless argument,<br>Then to his troops the chief who broke<br>His foe’s embattled armies spoke:<br>“Here let the troops in silence stay;<br>One step beyond they must not stray.<br>Come Dhrishṭi and Sumantra, you<br>With me alone the path pursue.”<br>Their leader’s speech the warriors heard,<br>And from his place no soldier stirred,<br>And Bharat bent his eager eyes<br>Where curling smoke was seen to rise.<br><br>  The host his order well obeyed,<br>And halting there in silence stayed<br>Watching where from the thicket’s shade<br>  They saw the smoke appear.<br>And joy through all the army ran,<br>“Soon shall we meet,” thought every man,<br>  “The prince we hold so dear.”
