                            Calm and unmoved by threatened woe<br>The noble conqueror of the foe<br>Answered the cruel words she spoke,<br>Nor quailed beneath the murderous stroke:<br><br>  “Yea, for my father’s promise sake<br>I to the wood my way will take,<br>And dwell a lonely exile there<br>In hermit dress with matted hair.<br>One thing alone I fain would learn,<br>Why is the king this day so stern?<br>Why is the scourge of foes so cold,<br>Nor gives me greeting as of old?<br>Now let not anger flush thy cheek:<br>Before thy face the truth I speak,<br>In hermit’s coat with matted hair<br>To the wild wood will I repair.<br>How can I fail his will to do,<br>Friend, master, grateful sovereign too?<br>One only pang consumes my breast:<br>That his own lips have not expressed<br>His will, nor made his longing known<br>That Bharat should ascend the throne.<br>To Bharat I would yield my wife,<br>My realm and wealth, mine own dear life,<br>Unasked I fain would yield them all:<br>More gladly at my father’s call,<br>More gladly when the gift may free<br>His honour and bring joy to thee.<br>Thus, lady, his sad heart release<br>From the sore shame, and give him peace.<br>But tell me, O, I pray thee, why<br>The lord of men, with downcast eye,<br>Lies prostrate thus, and one by one<br>Down his pale cheek the tear-drops run.<br>Let couriers to thy father speed<br>On horses of the swiftest breed,<br>And, by the mandate of the king,<br>Thy Bharat to his presence bring.<br>My father’s words I will not stay<br>To question, but this very day<br>To Daṇḍak’s pathless wild will fare,<br>For twice seven years an exile there.”<br><br>  When Ráma thus had made reply<br>Kaikeyí’s heart with joy beat high.<br>She, trusting to the pledge she held,<br>The youth’s departure thus impelled:<br>“’Tis well. Be messengers despatched<br>On coursers ne’er for fleetness matched,<br>To seek my father’s home and lead<br>My Bharat back with all their speed.<br>And, Ráma, as I ween that thou<br>Wilt scarce endure to linger now,<br>So surely it were wise and good<br>This hour to journey to the wood.<br>And if, with shame cast down and weak,<br>No word to thee the king can speak,<br>Forgive, and from thy mind dismiss<br>A trifle in an hour like this.<br>But till thy feet in rapid haste<br>Have left the city for the waste,<br>And to the distant forest fled,<br>He will not bathe nor call for bread.”<br><br>  “Woe! woe!” from the sad monarch burst,<br>In surging floods of grief immersed;<br>Then swooning, with his wits astray,<br>Upon the gold-wrought couch he lay,<br>And Ráma raised the aged king:<br>But the stern queen, unpitying,<br>Checked not her needless words, nor spared<br>The hero for all speed prepared,<br>But urged him with her bitter tongue,<br>Like a good horse with lashes stung,<br>She spoke her shameful speech. Serene<br>He heard the fury of the queen,<br>And to her words so vile and dread<br>Gently, unmoved in mind, he said:<br>“I would not in this world remain<br>A grovelling thrall to paltry gain,<br>But duty’s path would fain pursue,<br>True as the saints themselves are true.<br>From death itself I would not fly<br>My father’s wish to gratify,<br>What deed soe’er his loving son<br>May do to please him, think it done.<br>Amid all duties, Queen, I count<br>This duty first and paramount,<br>That sons, obedient, aye fulfil<br>Their honoured fathers’ word and will.<br>Without his word, if thou decree,<br>Forth to the forest will I flee,<br>And there shall fourteen years be spent<br>Mid lonely wilds in banishment.<br>Methinks thou couldst not hope to find<br>One spark of virtue in my mind,<br>If thou, whose wish is still my lord,<br>Hast for this grace the king implored.<br>This day I go, but, ere we part,<br>Must cheer my Sítá’s tender heart,<br>To my dear mother bid farewell;<br>Then to the woods, a while to dwell.<br>With thee, O Queen, the care must rest<br>That Bharat hear his sire’s behest,<br>And guard the land with righteous sway,<br>For such the law that lives for aye.”<br><br>  In speechless woe the father heard,<br>Wept with loud cries, but spoke no word.<br>Then Ráma touched his senseless feet,<br>And hers, for honour most unmeet;<br>Round both his circling steps he bent,<br>Then from the bower the hero went.<br>Soon as he reached the gate he found<br>His dear companions gathered round.<br>Behind him came Sumitrá’s child<br>With weeping eyes so sad and wild.<br>Then saw he all that rich array<br>Of vases for the glorious day.<br>Round them with reverent stops he paced,<br>Nor vailed his eye, nor moved in haste.<br>The loss of empire could not dim<br>The glory that encompassed him.<br>So will the Lord of Cooling Rays<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Moon.
