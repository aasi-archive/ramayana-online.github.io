                            As Lakshmaṇ still his vigil held<br>By unaffected love impelled,<br>Guha, whose heart the sight distressed,<br>With words like these the prince addressed:<br>“Beloved youth, this pleasant bed<br>Was brought for thee, for thee is spread;<br>On this, my Prince, thine eyelids close,<br>And heal fatigue with sweet repose.<br>My men are all to labour trained,<br>But hardship thou hast ne’er sustained.<br>All we this night our watch will keep<br>And guard Kakutstha’s son asleep.<br>In all the world there breathes not one<br>More dear to me than Raghu’s son.<br>The words I speak, heroic youth,<br>Are true: I swear it by my truth.<br>Through his dear grace supreme renown<br>Will, so I trust, my wishes crown.<br>So shall my life rich store obtain<br>Of merit, blest with joy and gain.<br>While Raghu’s son and Sítá lie<br>Entranced in happy slumber, I<br>Will, with my trusty bow in hand,<br>Guard my dear friend with all my band.<br>To me, who oft these forests range,<br>Is naught therein or new or strange.<br>We could with equal might oppose<br>A four-fold army led by foes.”<br><br>  Then royal Lakshmaṇ made reply:<br>“With thee to stand as guardian nigh,<br>Whose faithful soul regards the right,<br>Fearless we well might rest to-night.<br>But how, when Ráma lays his head<br>With Sítá on his lowly bed,—<br>How can I sleep? how can I care<br>For life, or aught that’s bright and fair?<br>Behold the conquering chief, whose might<br>Is match for Gods and fiends in fight;<br>With Sítá now he rests his head<br>Asleep on grass beneath him spread.<br>Won by devotion, text, and prayer,<br>And many a rite performed with care,<br>Chief of our father’s sons he shines<br>Well marked, like him, with favouring signs.<br>Brief, brief the monarch’s life will be<br>Now his dear son is forced to flee;<br>And quickly will the widowed state<br>Mourn for her lord disconsolate.<br>Each mourner there has wept her fill;<br>The cries of anguish now are still:<br>In the king’s hall each dame, o’ercome<br>With weariness of woe is dumb.<br>This first sad night of grief, I ween,<br>Will do to death each sorrowing queen:<br>Scarce is Kauśalyá left alive;<br>My mother, too, can scarce survive.<br>If when her heart is fain to break,<br>She lingers for Śatrughna’s sake,<br>Kauśalyá, mother of the chief,<br>Must sink beneath the chilling grief.<br>That town which countless thousands fill,<br>Whose hearts with love of Ráma thrill,—<br>The world’s delight, so rich and fair,—<br>Grieved for the king, his death will share.<br>The hopes he fondly cherished, crossed<br>Ayodhyá’s throne to Ráma lost,—<br>With mournful cries, Too late, too late!<br>The king my sire will meet his fate.<br>And when my sire has passed away,<br>Most happy in their lot are they,<br>Allowed, with every pious care,<br>Part in his funeral rites to bear.<br>And O, may we with joy at last,—<br>These years of forest exile past,—<br>Turn to Ayodhyá’s town to dwell<br>With him who keeps his promise well!”<br><br>  While thus the hero mighty-souled,<br>In wild lament his sorrow told,<br>Faint with the load that on him lay,<br>The hours of darkness passed away.<br>As thus the prince, impelled by zeal<br>For his loved brother, prompt to feel<br>Strong yearnings for the people’s weal,<br>  His words of truth outspake,<br>King Guha grieved to see his woe,<br>Heart-stricken, gave his tears to flow,<br>Tormented by the common blow,<br>  Sad, as a wounded snake.
