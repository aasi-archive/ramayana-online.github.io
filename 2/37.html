                            Thus spake the virtuous sage: and then<br>Ráma addressed the king of men.<br>In laws of meek behaviour bred,<br>Thus to his sire he meekly said:<br><br>  “King, I renounce all earthly care,<br>And live in woods on woodland fare.<br>What, dead to joys, have I to do<br>With lordly train and retinue!<br>Who gives his elephant and yet<br>Upon the girths his heart will set?<br>How can a cord attract his eyes<br>Who gives away the nobler prize?<br>Best of the good, with me be led<br>No host, my King with banners spread.<br>All wealth, all lordship I resign:<br>The hermit’s dress alone be mine.<br>Before I go, have here conveyed<br>A little basket and a spade.<br>With these alone I go, content,<br>For fourteen years of banishment.”<br><br>  With her own hands Kaikeyí took<br>The hermit coats of bark, and, “Look,”<br>She cried with bold unblushing brow<br>Before the concourse, “Dress thee now.”<br>That lion leader of the brave<br>Took from her hand the dress she gave,<br>Cast his fine raiment on the ground,<br>And round his waist the vesture bound.<br>Then quick the hero Lakshmaṇ too<br>His garment from his shoulders threw,<br>And, in the presence of his sire,<br>Indued the ascetic’s rough attire.<br>But Sítá, in her silks arrayed,<br>Threw glances, trembling and afraid,<br>On the bark coat she had to wear,<br>Like a shy doe that eyes the snare.<br>Ashamed and weeping for distress<br>From the queen’s hand she took the dress.<br>The fair one, by her husband’s side<br>Who matched heaven’s minstrel monarch,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Chitraratha, King of the celestial choristers.
