                            King Guha saw the host spread o’er<br>The wide expanse of Gangá’s shore,<br>With waving flag and pennon graced,<br>And to his followers spoke in haste:<br>“A mighty army meets my eyes,<br>That rivals Ocean’s self in size:<br>Where’er I look my very mind<br>No limit to the host can find.<br>Sure Bharat with some evil thought<br>His army to our land has brought.<br>See, huge of form, his flag he rears,<br>That like an Ebony-tree appears.<br>He comes with bonds to take and chain,<br>Or triumph o’er our people slain:<br>And after, Ráma will he slay,—<br>Him whom his father drove away:<br>The power complete he longs to gain,<br>And—task too hard—usurp the reign.<br>So Bharat comes with wicked will<br>His brother Ráma’s blood to spill.<br>But Ráma’s slave and friend am I;<br>He is my lord and dear ally.<br>Keep here your watch in arms arrayed<br>Near Gangá’s flood to lend him aid,<br>And let my gathered servants stand<br>And line with troops the river strand.<br>Here let the river keepers meet,<br>Who flesh and roots and berries eat;<br>A hundred fishers man each boat<br>Of the five hundred here afloat,<br>And let the youthful and the strong<br>Assemble in defensive throng.<br>But yet, if, free from guilty thought<br>’Gainst Ráma, he this land have sought,<br>The prince’s happy host to-day<br>Across the flood shall make its way.”<br><br>  He spoke: then bearing in a dish<br>A gift of honey, meat, and fish,<br>The king of the Nishádas drew<br>Toward Bharat for an interview.<br>When Bharat’s noble charioteer<br>Observed the monarch hastening near,<br>He duly, skilled in courteous lore,<br>The tidings to his master bore:<br>“This aged prince who hither bends<br>His footsteps with a thousand friends,<br>Knows, firm ally of Ráma, all<br>That may in Daṇḍak wood befall:<br>Therefore, Kakutstha’s son, admit<br>The monarch, as is right and fit:<br>For doubtless he can clearly tell<br>Where Ráma now and Lakshmaṇ dwell.”<br><br>  When Bharat heard Sumantra’s rede,<br>To his fair words the prince agreed:<br>“Go quickly forth,” he cried, “and bring<br>Before my face the aged king.”<br>King Guha, with his kinsmen near,<br>Rejoiced the summoning to hear:<br>He nearer drew, bowed low his head,<br>And thus to royal Bharat said:<br>“No mansions can our country boast,<br>And unexpected comes thy host:<br>But what we have I give thee all:<br>Rest in the lodging of thy thrall.<br>See, the Nishádas here have brought<br>The fruit and roots their hands have sought:<br>And we have woodland fare beside,<br>And store of meat both fresh and dried.<br>To rest their weary limbs, I pray<br>This night at least thy host may stay:<br>Then cheered with all we can bestow<br>To-morrow thou with it mayst go.”
