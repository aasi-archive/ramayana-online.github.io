                            The queen’s stern speech the monarch heard,<br>As rage and grief her bosom stirred,<br>And by his anguish sore oppressed<br>Reflected in his secret breast.<br>Fainting and sad, with woe distraught,<br>He wandered in a maze of thought;<br>At length the queller of the foe<br>Grew conscious, rallying from his woe.<br>When consciousness returned anew<br>Long burning sighs the monarch drew,<br>Again immersed in thought he eyed<br>Kauśalyá standing by his side.<br>Back to his pondering soul was brought<br>The direful deed his hand had wrought,<br>When, guiltless of the wrong intent,<br>His arrow at a sound was sent.<br>Distracted by his memory’s sting,<br>And mourning for his son, the king<br>To two consuming griefs a prey,<br>A miserable victim lay.<br>The double woe devoured him fast,<br>As on the ground his eyes he cast,<br>Joined suppliant hands, her heart to touch,<br>And spake in the answer, trembling much:<br>“Kauśalyá, for thy grace I sue,<br>Joining these hands as suppliants do.<br>Thou e’en to foes hast ever been<br>A gentle, good, and loving queen.<br>Her lord, with noble virtues graced,<br>Her lord, by lack of all debased,<br>Is still a God in woman’s eyes,<br>If duty’s law she hold and prize.<br>Thou, who the right hast aye pursued,<br>Life’s changes and its chances viewed,<br>Shouldst never launch, though sorrow-stirred,<br>At me distressed, one bitter word.”<br><br>  She listened, as with sorrow faint<br>He murmured forth his sad complaint:<br>Her brimming eyes with tears ran o’er,<br>As spouts the new fallen water pour;<br>His suppliant hands, with fear dismayed<br>She gently clasped in hers, and laid,<br>Like a fair lotus, on her head,<br>And faltering in her trouble said:<br>“Forgive me; at thy feet I lie,<br>With low bent head to thee I cry.<br>By thee besought, thy guilty dame<br>Pardon from thee can scarcely claim.<br>She merits not the name of wife<br>Who cherishes perpetual strife<br>With her own husband good and wise,<br>Her lord both here and in the skies.<br>I know the claims of duty well,<br>I know thy lips the truth must tell.<br>All the wild words I rashly spoke,<br>Forth from my heart, through anguish, broke;<br>For sorrow bends the stoutest soul,<br>And cancels Scripture’s high control.<br>Yea, sorrow’s might all else o’erthrows<br>The strongest and the worst of foes.<br>’Tis thus with all: we keenly feel,<br>Yet bear the blows our foemen deal,<br>But when a slender woe assails<br>The manliest spirit bends and quails.<br>The fifth long night has now begun<br>Since the wild woods have lodged my son:<br>To me whose joy is drowned in tears,<br>Each day a dreary year appears.<br>While all my thoughts on him are set<br>Grief at my heart swells wilder yet:<br>With doubled might thus Ocean raves<br>When rushing floods increase his waves.”<br><br>  As from Kauśalyá reasoning well<br>The gentle words of wisdom fell,<br>The sun went down with dying flame,<br>And darkness o’er the landscape came.<br>His lady’s soothing words in part<br>Relieved the monarch’s aching heart,<br>Who, wearied out by all his woes,<br>Yielded to sleep and took repose.
