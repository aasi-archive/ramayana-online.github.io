                            When Anasúyá, virtuous-souled,<br>Had heard the tale by Sítá told,<br>She kissed the lady’s brow and laced<br>Her loving arms around her waist.<br>“With sweet-toned words distinct and clear<br>Thy pleasant tale has charmed mine ear,<br>How the great king thy father held<br>That Maiden’s Choice unparalleled.<br>But now the sun has sunk from sight,<br>And left the world to holy Night.<br>Hark! how the leafy thickets sound<br>With gathering birds that twitter round:<br>They sought their food by day, and all<br>Flock homeward when the shadows fall.<br>See, hither comes the hermit band,<br>Each with his pitcher in his hand:<br>Fresh from the bath, their locks are wet,<br>Their coats of bark are dripping yet.<br>Here saints their fires of worship tend,<br>And curling wreaths of smoke ascend:<br>Borne on the flames they mount above,<br>Dark as the brown wings of the dove.<br>The distant trees, though well-nigh bare,<br>Gloom thickened by the evening air,<br>And in the faint uncertain light<br>Shut the horizon from our sight.<br>The beasts that prowl in darkness rove<br>On every side about the grove,<br>And the tame deer, at ease reclined<br>Their shelter near the altars find.<br>The night o’er all the sky is spread,<br>With lunar stars engarlanded,<br>And risen in his robes of light<br>The moon is beautifully bright.<br>Now to thy lord I bid thee go:<br>Thy pleasant tale has charmed me so:<br>One thing alone I needs must pray,<br>Before me first thyself array:<br>Here in thy heavenly raiment shine,<br>And glad, dear love, these eyes of mine.”<br>Then like a heavenly Goddess shone<br>Fair Sítá with that raiment on.<br>She bowed her to the matron’s feet,<br>Then turned away her lord to meet.<br>The hero prince with joy surveyed<br>His Sítá in her robes arrayed,<br>As glorious to his arms she came<br>With love-gifts of the saintly dame.<br>She told him how the saint to show<br>Her fond affection would bestow<br>That garland of celestial twine,<br>Those ornaments and robes divine.<br>Then Ráma’s heart, nor Lakshmaṇ’s less,<br>Was filled with pride and happiness,<br>For honours high had Sítá gained,<br>Which mortal dames have scarce obtained.<br>There honoured by each pious sage<br>Who dwelt within the hermitage,<br>Beside his darling well content<br>That sacred night the hero spent.<br><br>  The princes, when the night had fled,<br>Farewell to all the hermits said,<br>Who gazed upon the distant shade,<br>Their lustral rites and offerings paid.<br>The saints who made their dwelling there<br>In words like these addressed the pair:<br>“O Princes, monsters fierce and fell<br>Around that distant forest dwell:<br>On blood from human veins they feed,<br>And various forms assume at need,<br>With savage beasts of fearful power<br>That human flesh and blood devour.<br>Our holy saints they rend and tear<br>When met alone or unaware,<br>And eat them in their cruel joy:<br>These chase, O Ráma, or destroy.<br>By this one path our hermits go<br>To fetch the fruits that yonder grow:<br>By this, O Prince, thy feet should stray<br>Through pathless forests far away.”<br><br>  Thus by the reverent saints addressed,<br>And by their prayers auspicious blessed,<br>  He left the holy crowd:<br>His wife and brother by his side,<br>Within the mighty wood he hied.<br>So sinks the Day-God in his pride<br>  Beneath a bank of cloud.
