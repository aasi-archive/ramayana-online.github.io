                            When evening rites were duly paid,<br>Reclined beneath the leafy shade,<br>To Lakshmaṇ thus spake Ráma, best<br>Of those who glad a people’s breast:<br>“Now the first night has closed the day<br>That saw us from our country stray,<br>And parted from the charioteer;<br>Yet grieve not thou, my brother dear.<br>Henceforth by night, when others sleep,<br>Must we our careful vigil keep,<br>Watching for Sítá’s welfare thus,<br>For her dear life depends on us.<br>Bring me the leaves that lie around,<br>And spread them here upon the ground,<br>That we on lowly beds may lie,<br>And let in talk the night go by.”<br><br>  So on the ground with leaves o’erspread,<br>He who should press a royal bed,<br>Ráma with Lakshmaṇ thus conversed,<br>And many a pleasant tale rehearsed:<br>“This night the king,” he cried, “alas!<br>In broken sleep will sadly pass.<br>Kaikeyí now content should be,<br>For mistress of her wish is she.<br>So fiercely she for empire yearns,<br>That when her Bharat home returns,<br>She in her greed, may even bring<br>Destruction on our lord the king.<br>What can he do, in feeble eld,<br>Reft of all aid and me expelled,<br>His soul enslaved by love, a thrall<br>Obedient to Kaikeyí’s call?<br>As thus I muse upon his woe<br>And all his wisdoms overthrow,<br>Love is, methinks, of greater might<br>To stir the heart than gain and right.<br>For who, in wisdom’s lore untaught,<br>Could by a beauty’s prayer be bought<br>To quit his own obedient son,<br>Who loves him, as my sire has done!<br>Bharat, Kaikeyí’s child, alone<br>Will, with his wife, enjoy the throne,<br>And blissfully his rule maintain<br>O’er happy Kośala’s domain.<br>To Bharat’s single lot will fall<br>The kingdom and the power and all,<br>When fails the king from length of days,<br>And Ráma in the forest strays.<br>Whoe’er, neglecting right and gain,<br>Lets conquering love his soul enchain,<br>To him, like Daśaratha’s lot,<br>Comes woe with feet that tarry not.<br>Methinks at last the royal dame,<br>Dear Lakshmaṇ, has secured her aim,<br>To see at once her husband dead,<br>Her son enthroned, and Ráma fled.<br>Ah me! I fear, lest borne away<br>By frenzy of success, she slay<br>Kauśalyá, through her wicked hate<br>Of me, bereft, disconsolate;<br>Or her who aye for me has striven<br>Sumitrá, to devotion given.<br>Hence, Lakshmaṇ, to Ayodhyá speed,<br>Returning in the hour of need.<br>With Sítá I my steps will bend<br>Where Daṇḍak’s mighty woods extend.<br>No guardian has Kauśalyá now:<br>O, be her friend and guardian thou.<br>Strong hate may vile Kaikeyí lead<br>To many a base unrighteous deed,<br>Treading my mother ’neath her feet<br>When Bharat holds the royal seat.<br>Sure in some antenatal time<br>Were children, by Kauśalyá’s crime,<br>Torn from their mothers’ arms away,<br>And hence she mourns this evil day.<br>She for her child no toil would spare<br>Tending me long with pain and care;<br>Now in the hour of fruitage she<br>Has lost that son, ah, woe is me.<br>O Lakshmaṇ, may no matron e’er<br>A son so doomed to sorrow bear<br>As I, my mother’s heart who rend<br>With anguish that can never end.<br>The Sáriká,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The<em>&nbsp;Mainá</em> or Gracula religiosa, a favourite cage-bird, easily
