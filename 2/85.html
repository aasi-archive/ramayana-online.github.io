                            Thus the Nishádas’ king besought:<br>The prince with spirit wisdom-fraught<br>Replied in seemly words that blent<br>Deep matter with the argument:<br>“Thou, friend of him whom I revere,<br>With honours high hast met me here,<br>For thou alone wouldst entertain<br>And feed to-day so vast a train.”<br>In such fair words the prince replied,<br>Then, pointing to the path he cried:<br>“Which way aright will lead my feet<br>To Bharadvája’s calm retreat;<br>For all this land near Gangá’s streams<br>Pathless and hard to traverse seems?”<br><br>  Thus spoke the prince: King Guha heard<br>Delighted every prudent word,<br>And gazing on that forest wide,<br>Raised suppliant hands, and thus replied:<br>“My servants, all the ground who know,<br>O glorious Prince, with thee shall go<br>With constant care thy way to guide,<br>And I will journey by thy side.<br>But this thy host so wide dispread<br>Wakes in my heart one doubt and dread,<br>Lest, threatening Ráma good and great,<br>Ill thoughts thy journey stimulate.”<br><br>  But when King Guha, ill at ease,<br>Declared his fear in words like these,<br>As pure as is the cloudless sky<br>With soft voice Bharat made reply:<br>“Suspect me not: ne’er come the time<br>For me to plot so foul a crime!<br>He is my eldest brother, he<br>Is like a father dear to me.<br>I go to lead my brother thence<br>Who makes the wood his residence.<br>No thought but this thy heart should frame:<br>This simple truth my lips proclaim.”<br><br>  Then with glad cheer King Guha cried,<br>With Bharat’s answer gratified:<br>“Blessed art thou: on earth I see<br>None who may vie, O Prince, with thee,<br>Who canst of thy free will resign<br>The kingdom which unsought is thine.<br>For this, a name that ne’er shall die,<br>Thy glory through the worlds shall fly,<br>Who fain wouldst balm thy brother’s pain<br>And lead the exile home again.”<br><br>  As Guha thus, and Bharat, each<br>To other spoke in friendly speech,<br>The Day-God sank with glory dead,<br>And night o’er all the sky was spread.<br>Soon as King Guha’s thoughtful care<br>Had quartered all the army there,<br>Well honoured, Bharat laid his head<br>Beside Śatrughna on a bed.<br>But grief for Ráma yet oppressed<br>High-minded Bharat’s faithful breast—<br>Such torment little was deserved<br>By him who ne’er from duty swerved.<br>The fever raged through every vein<br>And burnt him with its inward pain:<br>So when in woods the flames leap free<br>The fire within consumes the tree.<br>From heat of burning anguish sprung<br>The sweat upon his body hung,<br>As when the sun with fervid glow<br>On high Himálaya melts the snow.<br>As, banished from the herd, a bull<br>Wanders alone and sorrowful.<br>  Thus sighing and distressed,<br>In misery and bitter grief,<br>With fevered heart that mocked relief,<br>Distracted in his mind, the chief<br>  Still mourned and found no rest.
