                            As Queen Kauśalyá, trembling much,<br>As blighted by a goblin’s touch,<br>Still lying prostrate, half awoke<br>To consciousness, ’twas thus she spoke:<br>“Bear me away, Sumantra, far,<br>Where Ráma, Sítá, Lakshmaṇ are.<br>Bereft of them I have no power<br>To linger on a single hour.<br>Again, I pray, thy steps retrace,<br>And me in Daṇḍak forest place,<br>For after them I needs must go,<br>Or sink to Yama’s realms below.”<br><br>  His utterance choked by tears that rolled<br>Down from their fountains uncontrolled,<br>With suppliant hands the charioteer<br>Thus spake, the lady’s heart to cheer:<br>“Dismiss thy grief, despair, and dread<br>That fills thy soul, of sorrow bred,<br>For pain and anguish thrown aside,<br>Will Ráma in the wood abide.<br>And Lakshmaṇ, with unfailing care<br>Will guard the feet of Ráma there,<br>Earning, with governed sense, the prize<br>That waits on duty in the skies.<br>And Sítá in the wild as well<br>As in her own dear home will dwell;<br>To Ráma all her heart she gives,<br>And free from doubt and terror lives.<br>No faintest sign of care or woe<br>The features of the lady show:<br>Methinks Videha’s pride was made<br>For exile in the forest shade.<br>E’en as of old she used to rove<br>Delighted in the city’s grove,<br>Thus, even thus she joys to tread<br>The woodlands uninhabited.<br>Like a young child, her face as fair<br>As the young moon, she wanders there.<br>What though in lonely woods she stray<br>Still Ráma is her joy and stay:<br>All his the heart no sorrow bends,<br>Her very life on him depends.<br>For, if her lord she might not see,<br>Ayodhyá like the wood would be.<br>She bids him, as she roams, declare<br>The names of towns and hamlets there,<br>Marks various trees that meet her eye,<br>And many a brook that hurries by,<br>And Janak’s daughter seems to roam<br>One little league away from home<br>When Ráma or his brother speaks<br>And gives the answer that she seeks.<br>This, Lady, I remember well,<br>Nor angry words have I to tell:<br>Reproaches at Kaikeyí shot,<br>Such, Queen, my mind remembers not.”<br>The speech when Sítá’s wrath was high,<br>Sumantra passed in silence by,<br>That so his pleasant words might cheer<br>With sweet report Kauśalyá’s ear.<br>“Her moonlike beauty suffers not<br>Though winds be rude and suns be hot:<br>The way, the danger, and the toil<br>Her gentle lustre may not soil.<br>Like the red lily’s leafy crown<br>Or as the fair full moon looks down,<br>So the Videhan lady’s face<br>Still shines with undiminished grace.<br>What if the borrowed colours throw<br>O’er her fine feet no rosy glow,<br>Still with their natural tints they spread<br>A lotus glory where they tread.<br>In sportive grace she walks the ground<br>And sweet her chiming anklets sound.<br>No jewels clasp the faultless limb:<br>She leaves them all for love of him.<br>If in the woods her gentle eye<br>A lion sees, or tiger nigh,<br>Or elephant, she fears no ill<br>For Ráma’s arm supports her still.<br>No longer be their fate deplored,<br>Nor thine, nor that of Kośal’s lord,<br>For conduct such as theirs shall buy<br>Wide glory that can never die.<br>For casting grief and care away,<br>Delighting in the forest, they<br>With joyful spirits, blithe and gay,<br>Set forward on the ancient way<br>  Where mighty saints have led:<br>Their highest aim, their dearest care<br>To keep their father’s honour fair,<br>Observing still the oath he sware,<br>  They roam, on wild fruit fed.”<br>Thus with persuasive art he tried<br>To turn her from her grief aside,<br>  By soothing fancies won.<br>But still she gave her sorrow vent:<br>“Ah Ráma,” was her shrill lament,<br>  “My love, my son, my son!”
