                            Thus Ráma spake. Her lord’s address<br>The lady heard with deep distress,<br>And, as the tear bedimmed her eye,<br>In soft low accents made reply:<br>“The perils of the wood, and all<br>The woes thou countest to appal,<br>Led by my love I deem not pain;<br>Each woe a charm, each loss a gain.<br>Tiger, and elephant, and deer,<br>Bull, lion, buffalo, in fear,<br>Soon as thy matchless form they see,<br>With every silvan beast will flee.<br>With thee, O Ráma, I must go:<br>My sire’s command ordains it so.<br>Bereft of thee, my lonely heart<br>Must break, and life and I must part.<br>While thou, O mighty lord, art nigh,<br>Not even He who rules the sky,<br>Though He is strongest of the strong,<br>With all his might can do me wrong.<br>Nor can a lonely woman left<br>By her dear husband live bereft.<br>In my great love, my lord, I ween,<br>The truth of this thou mayst have seen.<br>In my sire’s palace long ago<br>I heard the chief of those who know,<br>The truth-declaring Bráhmans, tell<br>My fortune, in the wood to dwell.<br>I heard their promise who divine<br>The future by each mark and sign,<br>And from that hour have longed to lead<br>The forest life their lips decreed.<br>Now, mighty Ráma, I must share<br>Thy father’s doom which sends thee there;<br>In this I will not be denied,<br>But follow, love, where thou shalt guide.<br>O husband, I will go with thee,<br>Obedient to that high decree.<br>Now let the Bráhmans’ words be true,<br>For this the time they had in view.<br>I know full well the wood has woes;<br>But they disturb the lives of those<br>Who in the forest dwell, nor hold<br>Their rebel senses well controlled.<br>In my sire’s halls, ere I was wed,<br>I heard a dame who begged her bread<br>Before my mother’s face relate<br>What griefs a forest life await.<br>And many a time in sport I prayed<br>To seek with thee the greenwood shade,<br>For O, my heart on this is set,<br>To follow thee, dear anchoret.<br>May blessings on thy life attend:<br>I long with thee my steps to bend,<br>For with such hero as thou art<br>This pilgrimage enchants my heart.<br>Still close, my lord, to thy dear side<br>My spirit will be purified:<br>Love from all sin my soul will free:<br>My husband is a God to me.<br>So, love, with thee shall I have bliss<br>And share the life that follows this.<br>I heard a Bráhman, dear to fame,<br>This ancient Scripture text proclaim:<br>“The woman whom on earth below<br>Her parents on a man bestow,<br>And lawfully their hands unite<br>With water and each holy rite,<br>She in this world shall be his wife,<br>His also in the after life.”<br>Then tell me, O beloved, why<br>Thou wilt this earnest prayer deny,<br>Nor take me with thee to the wood,<br>Thine own dear wife so true and good.<br>But if thou wilt not take me there<br>Thus grieving in my wild despair,<br>To fire or water I will fly,<br>Or to the poisoned draught, and die.”<br><br>  So thus to share his exile, she<br>Besought him with each earnest plea,<br>Nor could she yet her lord persuade<br>To take her to the lonely shade.<br>The answer of the strong-armed chief<br>Smote the Videhan’s soul with grief,<br>And from her eyes the torrents came<br>bathing the bosom of the dame.
