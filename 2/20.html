Spenser likens an infuriate woman to a cow “That is berobbed of her
youngling dere.” Shakspeare also makes King Henry VI compare himself
to the calf’s mother that “Runs lowing up and down, Looking the way
her harmless young one went.” “Cows,” says De Quincey, “are amongst
the gentlest of breathing creatures; none show more passionate
tenderness to their young, when deprived of them, and, in short, I
am not ashamed to profess a deep love for these gentle creatures.”
