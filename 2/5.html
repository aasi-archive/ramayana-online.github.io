                            Then Saint Vaśishṭha to the king<br>Came ready at his summoning.<br>“Now go,” exclaimed the monarch, “thou<br>Enriched by fervent rite and vow,<br>For Ráma and his wife ordain<br>The fast, that joy may bless his reign.”<br><br>  The best of those who Scripture know<br>Said to the king, “My lord, I go.”<br>To Ráma’s house Vaśishṭha hied,<br>The hero’s fast by rule to guide,<br>And skilled in sacred texts to tell<br>Each step to him instructed well.<br>Straight to Prince Ráma’s high abode,<br>That like a cloud pale-tinted showed,<br>Borne in his priestly car he rode.<br>Two courts he passed, and in the third<br>He stayed his car. Then Ráma heard<br>The holy sage was come, and flew<br>To honour him with honour due.<br>He hastened to the car and lent<br>His hand to aid the priest’s descent.<br>Then spoke Vaśishṭha words like these,<br>Pleased with his reverent courtesies,<br>With pleasant things his heart to cheer<br>Who best deserved glad news to hear:<br>“Prince, thou hast won thy father’s grace,<br>And thine will be the Regent’s place:<br>Now with thy Sítá, as is right,<br>In strictest fasting spend the night,<br>For when the morrow’s dawn is fair<br>The king will consecrate his heir:<br>So Nahush,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">A king of the Lunar race, and father of Yayáti.

</span></span> as the wise relate,<br>Yayáti joyed to consecrate.”<br><br>  Thus having said, Vaśishṭha next<br>Ordained the fast by rule and text,<br>For Ráma faithful to his vows<br>And the Videhan dame his spouse.<br>Then from the prince’s house he hied<br>With courteous honours gratified.<br>Round Ráma gathered every friend<br>In pleasant talk a while to spend.<br>He bade good night to all at last,<br>And to his inner chamber passed.<br>Then Ráma’s house shone bright and gay<br>With men and maids in glad array,<br>As in the morning some fair lake<br>When all her lotuses awake,<br>And every bird that loves the flood<br>Flits joyous round each opening bud.<br><br>  Forth from the house Vaśishṭha drove,<br>That with the king’s in splendour strove,<br>And all the royal street he viewed<br>Filled with a mighty multitude<br>The eager concourse blocked each square,<br>Each road and lane and thoroughfare,<br>And joyous shouts on every side<br>Rose like the roar of Ocean’s tide,<br>As streams of men together came<br>With loud huzza and glad acclaim.<br>The ways were watered, swept and clean,<br>And decked with flowers and garlands green<br>And all Ayodhyá shone arrayed<br>With banners on the roofs that played.<br>Men, women, boys with eager eyes,<br>Expecting when the sun should rise,<br>Stood longing for the herald ray<br>Of Ráma’s consecration day,<br>To see, a source of joy to all,<br>The people-honoured festival.<br><br>  The priest advancing slowly through<br>The mighty crowd he cleft in two,<br>Near to the monarch’s palace drew.<br>He sought the terrace, by the stair,<br>Like a white cloud-peak high in air,<br>The reverend king of men to meet<br>Who sate upon his splendid seat:<br>Thus will Vṛihaspati arise<br>To meet the monarch of the skies.<br>But when the king his coming knew,<br>He left his throne and near him drew<br>Questioned by him Vaśishṭha said<br>That all his task was duly sped.<br>Then all who sate there, honouring<br>Vaśishṭha, rose as rose the king.<br>Vaśishṭha bade his lord adieu,<br>And all the peers, dismissed, withdrew.<br>Then as a royal lion seeks<br>His cave beneath the rocky peaks,<br>So to the chambers where abode<br>His consorts Daśaratha strode.<br>  Full-thronged were those delightful bowers<br>    With women richly dressed,<br>  And splendid as the radiant towers<br>    Where Indra loves to rest.<br>  Then brighter flashed a thousand eyes<br>    With the light his presence lent,<br>  As, when the moon begins to rise<br>    The star thronged firmament.
