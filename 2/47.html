How can we say<br>We followed Ráma on his way,<br>The mighty chief whose arm is strong,<br>Who sweetly speaks, who thinks no wrong?<br>Ayodhyá’s town with sorrow dumb,<br>Without our lord will see us come,<br>And hopeless misery will strike<br>Elder, and child, and dame alike.<br>Forth with that peerless chief we came,<br>Whose mighty heart is aye the same:<br>How, reft of him we love, shall we<br>Returning dare that town to see?”<br><br>  Complaining thus with varied cry<br>They tossed their aged arms on high,<br>And their sad hearts with grief were wrung,<br>Like cows who sorrow for their young.<br>A while they followed on the road<br>Which traces of his chariot showed,<br>But when at length those traces failed,<br>A deep despair their hearts assailed.<br>The chariot marks no more discerned,<br>The hopeless sages backward turned:<br>“Ah, what is this? What can we more?<br>Fate stops the way, and all is o’er.”<br>With wearied hearts, in grief and shame<br>They took the road by which they came,<br>And reached Ayodhyá’s city, where<br>From side to side was naught but care.<br>With troubled spirits quite cast down<br>They looked upon the royal town,<br>And from their eyes, oppressed with woe,<br>Their tears again began to flow.<br>Of Ráma reft, the city wore<br>No look of beauty as before,<br>Like a dull river or a lake<br>By Garuḍ robbed of every snake.<br>Dark, dismal as the moonless sky,<br>Or as a sea whose bed is dry,<br>So sad, to every pleasure dead,<br>They saw the town, disquieted.<br>On to their houses, high and vast,<br>Where stores of precious wealth were massed,<br>The melancholy Bráhmans passed,<br>  Their hearts with anguish cleft:<br>Aloof from all, they came not near<br>To stranger or to kinsman dear,<br>Showing in faces blank and drear<br>  That not one joy was left.
