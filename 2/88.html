                            When Bharat with each friend and peer<br>Had heard that tale so full and clear,<br>They went together to the tree<br>The bed which Ráma pressed to see.<br>Then Bharat to his mothers said:<br>“Behold the high-souled hero’s bed:<br>These tumbled heaps of grass betray<br>Where he that night with Sítá lay:<br>Unmeet, the heir of fortune high<br>Thus on the cold bare earth should lie,<br>The monarch’s son, in counsel sage,<br>Of old imperial lineage.<br>That lion-lord whose noble bed<br>With finest skins of deer was spread,—<br>How can he now endure to press<br>The bare earth, cold and comfortless!<br>This sudden fall from bliss to grief<br>Appears untrue, beyond belief:<br>My senses are distraught: I seem<br>To view the fancies of a dream.<br>There is no deity so great,<br>No power in heaven can master Fate,<br>If Ráma, Daśaratha’s heir,<br>Lay on the ground and slumbered there;<br>And lovely Sítá, she who springs<br>From fair Videha’s ancient kings,<br>Ráma’s dear wife, by all adored,<br>Lay on the earth beside her lord.<br>Here was his couch, upon this heap<br>He tossed and turned in restless sleep:<br>On the hard soil each manly limb<br>Has stamped the grass with signs of him.<br>That night, it seems, fair Sítá spent<br>Arrayed in every ornament,<br>For here and there my eyes behold<br>Small particles of glistering gold.<br>She laid her outer garment here,<br>For still some silken threads appear,<br>How dear in her devoted eyes<br>Must be the bed where Ráma lies,<br>Where she so tender could repose<br>And by his side forget her woes.<br>Alas, unhappy, guilty me!<br>For whom the prince was forced to flee,<br>And chief of Raghu’s sons and best,<br>A bed like this with Sítá pressed.<br>Son of a royal sire whose hand<br>Ruled paramount o’er every land,<br>Could he who every joy bestows,<br>Whose body like the lotus shows,<br>The friend of all, who charms the sight,<br>Whose flashing eyes are darkly bright,<br>Leave the dear kingdom, his by right,<br>Unmeet for woe, the heir of bliss,<br>And lie upon a bed like this?<br>Great joy and happy fate are thine,<br>O Lakshmaṇ, marked with each fair sign,<br>Whose faithful footsteps follow still<br>Thy brother in his hour of ill.<br>And blest is Sítá, nobly good,<br>Who dwells with Ráma in the wood.<br>Ours is, alas, a doubtful fate<br>Of Ráma reft and desolate.<br>My royal sire has gained the skies,<br>In woods the high-souled hero lies;<br>The state is wrecked and tempest-tossed,<br>A vessel with her rudder lost.<br>Yet none in secret thought has planned<br>With hostile might to seize the land:<br>Though forced in distant wilds to dwell,<br>The hero’s arm protects it well.<br>Unguarded, with deserted wall,<br>No elephant or steed in stall,<br>My father’s royal city shows<br>Her portals open to her foes,<br>Of bold protectors reft and bare,<br>Defenceless in her dark despair:<br>But still her foes the wish restrain,<br>As men from poisoned cates refrain.<br>I from this hour my nights will pass<br>Couched on the earth or gathered grass,<br>Eat only fruit and roots, and wear<br>A coat of bark, and matted hair.<br>I in the woods will pass, content,<br>For him the term of banishment;<br>So shall I still unbroken save<br>The promise which the hero gave.<br>While I remain for Ráma there,<br>Śatrughna will my exile share,<br>And Ráma in his home again,<br>With Lakshmaṇ, o’er Ayodhyá reign,<br>for him, to rule and guard the state,<br>The twice-born men shall consecrate.<br>O, may the Gods I serve incline<br>To grant this earnest wish of mine!<br>If when I bow before his feet<br>And with all moving arts entreat,<br>  He still deny my prayer,<br>Then with my brother will I live:<br>He must, he must permission give,<br>  Roaming in forests there.”
