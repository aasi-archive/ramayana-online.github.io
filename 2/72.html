                            He entered in, he looked around,<br>Nor in the house his father found;<br>Then to his mother’s dwelling, bent<br>To see her face, he quickly went.<br>She saw her son, so long away,<br>Returning after many a day,<br>And from her golden seat in joy<br>Sprung forward to her darling boy.<br>Within the bower, no longer bright,<br>Came Bharat lover of the right,<br>And bending with observance sweet<br>Clasped his dear mother’s lovely feet.<br>Long kisses on his brow she pressed,<br>And held her hero to her breast,<br>Then fondly drew him to her knees,<br>And questioned him in words like these:<br>“How many nights have fled, since thou<br>Leftest thy grandsire’s home, till now?<br>By flying steeds so swiftly borne,<br>Art thou not weak and travel-worn?<br>How fares the king my father, tell:<br>Is Yudhájit thine uncle well?<br>And now, my son, at length declare<br>The pleasure of the visit there.”<br><br>  Thus to the offspring of the king<br>She spake with tender questioning,<br>And to his mother made reply<br>Young Bharat of the lotus eye:<br>“The seventh night has come and fled<br>Since from my grandsire’s home I sped:<br>My mother’s sire is well, and he,<br>Yudhájit, from all trouble free.<br>The gold and every precious thing<br>Presented by the conqueror king,<br>The slower guards behind convey:<br>I left them weary on the way.<br>Urged by the men my father sent,<br>My hasty course I hither bent:<br>Now, I implore, an answer deign,<br>And all I wish to know, explain.<br>Unoccupied I now behold<br>This couch of thine adorned with gold,<br>And each of King Ikshváku’s race<br>Appears with dark and gloomy face.<br>The king is aye, my mother dear,<br>Most constant in his visits here.<br>To meet my sire I sought this spot:<br>How is it that I find him not?<br>I long to clasp my father’s feet:<br>Say where he lingers, I entreat.<br>Perchance the monarch may be seen<br>Where dwells Kauśalyá, eldest queen.”<br><br>  His father’s fate, from him concealed,<br>Kaikeyí to her son revealed:<br>Told as glad news the story sad,<br>For lust of sway had made her mad:<br>“Thy father, O my darling, know,<br>Has gone the way all life must go:<br>Devout and famed, of lofty thought,<br>In whom the good their refuge sought.”<br><br>  When Bharat pious, pure, and true,<br>Heard the sad words which pierced him through,<br>Grieved for the sire he loved so well<br>Prostrate upon the ground he fell:<br>Down fell the strong-armed hero, high<br>Tossing his arms, and a sad cry,<br>“Ah, woe is me, unhappy, slain!”<br>Burst from his lips again, again,<br>Afflicted for his father’s fate<br>By grief’s intolerable weight,<br>With every sense amazed and cowed<br>The splendid hero wailed aloud:<br>“Ah me, my royal father’s bed<br>Of old a gentle radiance shed,<br>Like the pure sky when clouds are past,<br>And the moon’s light is o’er it cast:<br>Ah, of its wisest lord bereft,<br>It shows to-day faint radiance left,<br>As when the moon has left the sky.<br>Or mighty Ocean’s depths are dry.”<br><br>  With choking sobs, with many a tear,<br>Pierced to the heart with grief sincere,<br>The best of conquerors poured his sighs,<br>And with his robe veiled face and eyes.<br>Kaikeyí saw him fallen there,<br>Godlike, afflicted, in despair,<br>Used every art to move him thence,<br>And tried him thus with eloquence:<br>“Arise, arise, my dearest; why<br>Wilt thou, famed Prince, so lowly lie?<br>Not by such grief as this are moved<br>Good men like thee, by all approved.<br>The earth thy father nobly swayed,<br>And rites to Heaven he duly paid.<br>At length his race of life was run:<br>Thou shouldst not mourn for him, my son.”<br><br>  Long on the ground he wept, and rolled<br>From side to side, still unconsoled,<br>And then, with bitter grief oppressed,<br>His mother with these words addressed:<br>“This joyful hope my bosom fed<br>When from my grandsire’s halls I sped—<br>“The king will throne his eldest son,<br>And sacrifice, as should be done.”<br>But all is changed, my hope was vain,<br>And this sad heart is rent in twain,<br>For my dear father’s face I miss,<br>Who ever sought his loved ones’ bliss.<br>But in my absence, mother, say,<br>What sickness took my sire away?<br>Ah, happy Ráma, happy they<br>Allowed his funeral rites to pay!<br>The glorious monarch has not learned<br>That I his darling have returned,<br>Or quickly had he hither sped,<br>And pressed his kisses on my head.<br>Where is that hand whose gentle touch,<br>Most soft and kind I loved so much,<br>The hand that loved to brush away<br>The dust that on his darling lay?<br>Quick, bear the news to Ráma’s ear;<br>Tell the great chief that I am here:<br>Brother, and sire, and friend, and all<br>Is he, and I his trusty thrall.<br>For noble hearts, to virtue true,<br>Their sires in elder brothers view.<br>To clasp his feet I fain would bow:<br>He is my hope and refuge now.<br>What said my glorious sire, who knew<br>Virtue and vice, so brave and true?<br>Firm in his vows, dear lady, say,<br>What said he ere he passed away?<br>What was his rede to me? I crave<br>To hear the last advice he gave.”<br><br>  Thus closely questioned by the youth,<br>Kaikeyí spoke the mournful truth:<br>“The high-souled monarch wept and sighed,<br>For Ráma, Sítá, Lakshmaṇ, cried,<br>Then, best of all who go to bliss,<br>Passed to the world which follows this.<br>“Ah, blessed are the people who<br>Shall Ráma and his Sítá view,<br>And Lakshmaṇ of the mighty arm,<br>Returning free from scathe and harm.”<br>Such were the words, the last of all,<br>Thy father, ere he died, let fall,<br>By Fate and Death’s dread coils enwound,<br>As some great elephant is bound.”<br><br>  He heard, yet deeper in despair,<br>Her lips this double woe declare,<br>And with sad brow that showed his pain<br>Questioned his mother thus again:<br>“But where is he, of virtue tried,<br>Who fills Kauśalyá’s heart with pride,<br>Where is the noble Ráma? where<br>Is Lakshmaṇ brave, and Sítá fair?”<br><br>  Thus pressed, the queen began to tell<br>The story as each thing befell,<br>And gave her son in words like these,<br>The mournful news she meant to please:<br>“The prince is gone in hermit dress<br>To Daṇḍak’s mighty wilderness,<br>And Lakshmaṇ brave and Sítá share<br>The wanderings of the exile there.”<br><br>  Then Bharat’s soul with fear was stirred<br>Lest Ráma from the right had erred,<br>And jealous for ancestral fame,<br>He put this question to the dame:<br>“Has Ráma grasped with lawless hold<br>A Bráhman’s house, or land, or gold?<br>Has Ráma harmed with ill intent<br>Some poor or wealthy innocent?<br>Was Ráma, faithless to his vows,<br>Enamoured of anothers spouse?<br>Why was he sent to Daṇḍak’s wild,<br>Like one who kills an unborn child?”<br><br>  He questioned thus: and she began<br>To tell her deeds and crafty plan.<br>Deceitful-hearted, fond, and blind<br>As is the way of womankind:<br>“No Bráhman’s wealth has Ráma seized,<br>No dame his wandering fancy pleased;<br>His very eyes he ne’er allows<br>To gaze upon a neighbour’s spouse.<br>But when I heard the monarch planned<br>To give the realm to Ráma’s hand,<br>I prayed that Ráma hence might flee,<br>And claimed the throne, my son, for thee.<br>The king maintained the name he bare,<br>And did according to my prayer,<br>And Ráma, with his brother, sent,<br>And Sítá, forth to banishment.<br>When his dear son was seen no more,<br>The lord of earth was troubled sore:<br>Too feeble with his grief to strive,<br>He joined the elemental Five.<br>Up then, most dutiful! maintain<br>The royal state, arise, and reign.<br>For thee, my darling son, for thee<br>All this was planned and wrought by me.<br>Come, cast thy grief and pain aside,<br>With manly courage fortified.<br>This town and realm are all thine own,<br>And fear and grief are here unknown.<br>Come, with Vaśishṭha’s guiding aid,<br>  And priests in ritual skilled<br>Let the king’s funeral dues be paid,<br>  And every claim fulfilled.<br>Perform his obsequies with all<br>  That suits his rank and worth,<br>Then give the mandate to install<br>  Thyself as lord of earth.”
