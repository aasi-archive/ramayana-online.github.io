                            When Ráma heard from Bharat each<br>Dark sorrow of his mournful speech,<br>And tidings of his father dead,<br>His spirits fell, his senses fled.<br>For the sad words his brother spoke<br>Struck on him like a thunder stroke,<br>Fierce as the bolt which Indra throws,<br>The victor of his Daitya foes.<br>Raising his arms in anguish, he,<br>As when the woodman hews a tree<br>With its fair flowery branches crowned,<br>Fainted and fell upon the ground.<br>Lord of the earth to earth he sank,<br>Helpless, as when a towering bank<br>With sudden ruin buries deep<br>An elephant who lay asleep.<br>Then swift his wife and brothers flew,<br>And water, weeping, o’er him threw.<br>As slowly sense and strength he gained,<br>Fast from his eyes the tears he rained,<br>And then in accents sad and weak<br>Kakutstha’s son began to speak,<br>And mourning for the monarch dead,<br>With righteous words to Bharat said:<br>“What calls me home, when he, alas,<br>Has gone the way which all must pass?<br>Of him, the best of kings bereft<br>What guardian has Ayodhyá left?<br>How may I please his spirit? how<br>Delight the high-souled monarch now,<br>Who wept for me and went above<br>By me ungraced with mourning love?<br>Ah, happy brothers! you have paid<br>Due offerings to his parting shade.<br>E’en when my banishment is o’er,<br>Back to my home I go no more,<br>To look upon the widowed state<br>Reft of her king, disconsolate.<br>E’en then, O tamer of the foe,<br>If to Ayodhyá’s town I go,<br>Who will direct me as of old,<br>Now other worlds our father hold?<br>From whom, my brother, shall I hear<br>Those words which ever charmed mine ear<br>And filled my bosom with delight<br>Whene’er he saw me act aright?”<br><br>  Thus Ráma spoke: then nearer came<br>And looking on his moonbright dame,<br>“Sítá, the king is gone,” he said:<br>“And Lakshmaṇ, know thy sire is dead,<br>And with the Gods on high enrolled:<br>This mournful news has Bharat told.”<br>He spoke: the noble youths with sighs<br>Rained down the torrents from their eyes.<br>And then the brothers of the chief<br>With words of comfort soothed his grief:<br>“Now to the king our sire who swayed<br>The earth be due libations paid.”<br>Soon as the monarch’s fate she knew,<br>Sharp pangs of grief smote Sítá through:<br>Nor could she look upon her lord<br>With eyes from which the torrents poured.<br>And Ráma strove with tender care<br>To soothe the weeping dame’s despair,<br>And then, with piercing woe distressed,<br>The mournful Lakshmaṇ thus addressed:<br>“Brother, I pray thee bring for me<br>The pressed fruit of the Ingudí,<br>And a bark mantle fresh and new,<br>That I may pay this offering due.<br>First of the three shall Sítá go,<br>Next thou, and I the last: for so<br>Moves the funereal pomp of woe.”<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">“The order of the procession on these occasions is that the children
