                            The lion chief with hands upraised<br>Was born from eyes that fondly gazed.<br>But then the ladies’ bower was rent<br>With cries of weeping and lament:<br>“Where goes he now, our lord, the sure<br>Protector of the friendless poor,<br>In whom the wretched and the weak<br>Defence and aid were wont to seek?<br>All words of wrath he turned aside,<br>And ne’er, when cursed, in ire replied.<br>He shared his people’s woe, and stilled<br>The troubled breast which rage had filled.<br>Our chief, on lofty thoughts intent,<br>In glorious fame preëminent:<br>As on his own dear mother, thus<br>He ever looked on each of us.<br>Where goes he now? His sire’s behest,<br>By Queen Kaikeyí’s guile distressed,<br>Has banished to the forest hence<br>Him who was all the world’s defence.<br>Ah, senseless King, to drive away<br>The hope of men, their guard and stay,<br>To banish to the distant wood<br>Ráma the duteous, true, and good!”<br>The royal dames, like cows bereaved<br>Of their young calves, thus sadly grieved.<br>The monarch heard them as they wailed,<br>And by the fire of grief assailed<br>For his dear son, he bowed his head,<br>And all his sense and memory fled.<br><br>  Then were no fires of worship fed,<br>Thick darkness o’er the sun was spread.<br>The cows their thirsty calves denied,<br>And elephants flung their food aside.<br>Triśanku,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">See p. 72.
