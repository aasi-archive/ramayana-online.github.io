It is still reported in Belgaum that Appay Deasy was wont to amuse
himself “by making several young and beautiful women stand side by
side on a narrow balcony, without a parapet, overhanging the deep
reservoir at the new palace in Nipani. He used then to pass along
the line of trembling creatures, and suddenly thrusting one of them
headlong into the water below, he used to watch her drowning, and
derive pleasure from her dying agonies.”—History of the Belgaum
District. By H. J. Stokes, M. S. C.
