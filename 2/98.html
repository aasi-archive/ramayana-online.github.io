                            Then Ráma nobly calm allayed<br>The wrath that Lakshmaṇ’s bosom swayed:<br>“What need have we the sword to wield,<br>To bend the bow or lift the shield,<br>If Bharat brave, and wise, and good,<br>Himself has sought this sheltering wood?<br>I sware my father’s will to do,<br>And if I now my brother slew<br>What gain in kingship should I find,<br>Despised and scorned by all mankind?<br>Believe me, e’en as I would shrink<br>From poisoned meat or deadly drink,<br>No power or treasure would I win<br>By fall of friend or kith or kin.<br>Brother, believe the words I speak:<br>For your dear sakes alone I seek<br>Duty and pleasure, wealth and gain:<br>A holy life, a happy reign.<br>If royal sway my heart desires,<br>My brothers’ weal the wish inspires:<br>Their bliss and safety is my care,<br>By this uplifted bow I swear.<br>’Twere not so hard for me to gain<br>This broad land girdled by the main,<br>But even Indra’s royal might<br>Should ne’er be mine in duty’s spite.<br>If any bliss my soul can see<br>Deprived of dear Śatrughna, thee,<br>And Bharat, may the flame destroy<br>With ashy gloom the selfish joy.<br>Far dearer than this life of mine,<br>Knowing the custom of our line,<br>His heart with fond affection fraught,<br>Bharat Ayodhyá’s town resought<br>And hearing when he came that I,<br>With thee and Sítá, forced to fly<br>With matted hair and hermit dress<br>Am wandering in the wilderness.<br>While grief his troubled senses storms,<br>And tender love his bosom warms,<br>From every thought of evil clear,<br>Is come to meet his brother here.<br>Some grievous words perchance he spoke<br>Kaikeyí’s anger to provoke,<br>Then won the king, and comes to lay<br>Before my feet the royal sway.<br>Hither, methinks, in season due<br>Comes Bharat for an interview,<br>Nor in his secret heart has he<br>One evil thought ’gainst thee or me.<br>What has he done ere now, reflect!<br>How failed in love or due respect<br>To make thee doubt his faith and lay<br>This evil to his charge to-day?<br>Thou shouldst not join with Bharat’s name<br>So harsh a speech and idle blame.<br>The blows thy tongue at Bharat deals,<br>My sympathizing bosom feels.<br>How, urged by stress of any ill,<br>Should sons their father’s life-blood spill,<br>Or brother slay in impious strife<br>A brother dearer than his life?<br>If thou these cruel words hast said<br>By strong desire of empire led,<br>My brother Bharat will I pray<br>To give to thee the kingly sway.<br>“Give him the realm,” my speech shall be,<br>And Bharat will, methinks, agree.”<br><br>  Thus spoke the prince whose chief delight<br>Was duty, and to aid the right:<br>And Lakshmaṇ keenly felt the blame,<br>And shrank within himself for shame:<br>And then his answer thus returned,<br>With downcast eye and cheek that burned:<br>“Brother, I ween, to see thy face<br>Our sire himself has sought this place.”<br>Thus Lakshmaṇ spoke and stood ashamed,<br>And Ráma saw and thus exclaimed:<br>“It is the strong-armed monarch: he<br>Is come, methinks, his sons to see,<br>To bid us both the forest quit<br>For joys for which he deems us fit:<br>He thinks on all our care and pain,<br>And now would lead us home again.<br>My glorious father hence will bear<br>Sítá who claims all tender care.<br>I see two coursers fleet as storms,<br>Of noble breed and lovely forms.<br>I see the beast of mountain size<br>Who bears the king our father wise,<br>The aged Victor, march this way<br>In front of all the armed array.<br>But doubt and fear within me rise,<br>For when I look with eager eyes<br>I see no white umbrella spread,<br>World-famous, o’er the royal head.<br>Now, Lakshmaṇ, from the tree descend,<br>And to my words attention lend.”<br><br>  Thus spoke the pious prince: and he<br>Descended from the lofty tree,<br>And reverent hand to hand applied,<br>Stood humbly by his brother’s side.<br><br>  The host, compelled by Bharat’s care,<br>The wood from trampling feet to spare,<br>Dense crowding half a league each way<br>Encamped around the mountain lay.<br>Below the tall hill’s shelving side<br>Gleamed the bright army far and wide<br>  Spread o’er the ample space,<br>By Bharat led who firmly true<br>In duty from his bosom threw<br>All pride, and near his brother drew<br>  To win the hero’s grace.
