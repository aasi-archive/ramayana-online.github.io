observes<em>&nbsp;Vishṇu Puráṇa</em>, p. 139. Dr. Hall’s Edition) “States, and
tribes, and cities have disappeared, even from recollection; and
some of the natural features of the country, especially the rivers,
have undergone a total alteration.… Notwithstanding these
impediments, however, we should be able to identify at least
mountains and rivers, to a much greater extent than is now
practicable, if our maps were not so miserably defective in their
nomenclature. None of our surveyors or geographers have been
oriental scholars. It may be doubted if any of them have been
conversant with the spoken language of the country. They have,
consequently, put down names at random, according to their own
inaccurate appreciation of sounds carelessly, vulgarly, and
corruptly uttered; and their maps of India are crowded with
appellations which bear no similitude whatever either to past or
present denominations. We need not wonder that we cannot discover
Sanskrit names in English maps, when, in the immediate vicinity of
Calcutta, Barnagore represents Baráhanagar, Dakshineśwar is
metamorphosed into Duckinsore, Ulubaría into Willoughbury.… There is
scarcely a name in our Indian maps that does not afford proof of
extreme indifference to accuracy in nomenclature, and of an
incorrectness in estimating sounds, which is, in some degree,
perhaps, a national defect.”
