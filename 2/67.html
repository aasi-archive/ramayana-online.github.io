                            That night of sorrow passed away,<br>And rose again the God of Day.<br>Then all the twice-born peers of state<br>Together met for high debate.<br>Jáválí, lord of mighty fame.<br>And Gautam, and Kátyáyan came,<br>And Márkandeya’s reverend age,<br>And Vámadeva, glorious sage:<br>Sprung from Mudgalya’s seed the one,<br>The other ancient Kaśyap’s son.<br>With lesser lords these Bráhmans each<br>Spoke in his turn his several speech,<br>And turning to Vaśishṭha, best<br>Of household priests him thus addressed:<br>“The night of bitter woe has past,<br>Which seemed a hundred years to last,<br>Our king, in sorrow for his son,<br>Reunion with the Five has won.<br>His soul is where the blessed are,<br>While Ráma roams in woods afar,<br>And Lakshmaṇ, bright in glorious deeds,<br>Goes where his well-loved brother leads.<br>And Bharat and Śatrughna, they<br>Who smite their foes in battle fray,<br>Far in the realm of Kekaya stay,<br>Where their maternal grandsire’s care<br>Keeps Rájagriha’s city fair.<br>Let one of old Ikshváku’s race<br>Obtain this day the sovereign’s place,<br>Or havoc and destruction straight<br>Our kingless land will devastate.<br>In kingless lands no thunder’s voice,<br>No lightning wreaths the heart rejoice,<br>Nor does Parjanya’s heavenly rain<br>Descend upon the burning plain.<br>Where none is king, the sower’s hand<br>Casts not the seed upon the land;<br>The son against the father strives.<br>And husbands fail to rule their wives.<br>In kingless realms no princes call<br>Their friends to meet in crowded hall;<br>No joyful citizens resort<br>To garden trim or sacred court.<br>In kingless realms no Twice-born care<br>To sacrifice with text and prayer,<br>Nor Bráhmans, who their vows maintain,<br>The great solemnities ordain.<br>The joys of happier days have ceased:<br>No gathering, festival, or feast<br>Together calls the merry throng<br>Delighted with the play and song.<br>In kingless lands it ne’er is well<br>With sons of trade who buy and sell:<br>No men who pleasant tales repeat<br>Delight the crowd with stories sweet.<br>In kingless realms we ne’er behold<br>Young maidens decked with gems and gold,<br>Flock to the gardens blithe and gay<br>To spend their evening hours in play.<br>No lover in the flying car<br>Rides with his love to woods afar.<br>In kingless lands no wealthy swain<br>Who keeps the herd and reaps the grain,<br>Lies sleeping, blest with ample store,<br>Securely near his open door.<br>Upon the royal roads we see<br>No tusked elephant roaming free,<br>Of three-score years, whose head and neck<br>Sweet tinkling bells of silver deck.<br>We hear no more the glad applause<br>When his strong bow each rival draws,<br>No clap of hands, no eager cries<br>That cheer each martial exercise.<br>In kingless realms no merchant bands<br>Who travel forth to distant lands,<br>With precious wares their wagons load,<br>And fear no danger on the road.<br>No sage secure in self-control,<br>Brooding on God with mind and soul,<br>In lonely wanderings finds his home<br>Where’er at eve his feet may roam.<br>In kingless realms no man is sure<br>He holds his life and wealth secure.<br>In kingless lands no warriors smite<br>The foeman’s host in glorious fight.<br>In kingless lands the wise no more,<br>Well trained in Scripture’s holy lore,<br>In shady groves and gardens meet<br>To argue in their calm retreat.<br>No longer, in religious fear,<br>Do they who pious vows revere,<br>Bring dainty cates and wreaths of flowers<br>As offerings to the heavenly powers.<br>No longer, bright as trees in spring,<br>Shine forth the children of the king<br>Resplendent in the people’s eyes<br>With aloe wood and sandal dyes.<br>A brook where water once has been,<br>A grove where grass no more is green,<br>Kine with no herdsman’s guiding hand—<br>So wretched is a kingless land.<br>The car its waving banner rears,<br>Banner of fire the smoke appears:<br>Our king, the banner of our pride,<br>A God with Gods is glorified.<br>In kingless lands no law is known,<br>And none may call his wealth his own,<br>Each preys on each from hour to hour,<br>As fish the weaker fish devour.<br>Then fearless, atheists overleap<br>The bounds of right the godly keep,<br>And when no royal powers restrain,<br>Preëminence and lordship gain.<br>As in the frame of man the eye<br>Keeps watch and ward, a careful spy,<br>The monarch in his wide domains<br>Protects the truth, the right maintains.<br>He is the right, the truth is he,<br>Their hopes in him the well-born see.<br>On him his people’s lives depend,<br>Mother is he, and sire, and friend.<br>The world were veiled in blinding night,<br>And none could see or know aright,<br>Ruled there no king in any state<br>The good and ill to separate.<br>We will obey thy word and will<br>As if our king were living still:<br>As keeps his bounds the faithful sea,<br>So we observe thy high decree.<br>O best of Bráhmans, first in place,<br>  Our kingless land lies desolate:<br>Some scion of Ikshváku’s race<br>  Do thou as monarch consecrate.”
