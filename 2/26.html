                            So Ráma, to his purpose true,<br>To Queen Kauśalyá bade adieu,<br>Received the benison she gave,<br>And to the path of duty clave.<br>As through the crowded street he passed,<br>A radiance on the way he cast,<br>And each fair grace, by all approved,<br>The bosoms of the people moved.<br><br>  Now of the woeful change no word<br>The fair Videhan bride had heard;<br>The thought of that imperial rite<br>Still filled her bosom with delight.<br>With grateful heart and joyful thought<br>The Gods in worship she had sought,<br>And, well in royal duties learned,<br>Sat longing till her lord returned,<br>Not all unmarked by grief and shame<br>Within his sumptuous home he came,<br>And hurried through the happy crowd<br>With eye dejected, gloomy-browed.<br>Up Sítá sprang, and every limb<br>Trembled with fear at sight of him.<br>She marked that cheek where anguish fed,<br>Those senses care-disquieted.<br>For, when he looked on her, no more<br>Could his heart hide the load it bore,<br>Nor could the pious chief control<br>The paleness o’er his cheek that stole.<br>His altered cheer, his brow bedewed<br>With clammy drops, his grief she viewed,<br>And cried, consumed with fires of woe,<br>“What, O my lord, has changed thee so?<br>Vrihaspati looks down benign,<br>And the moon rests in Pushya’s sign,<br>As Bráhmans sage this day declare:<br>Then whence, my lord, this grief and care?<br>Why does no canopy, like foam<br>For its white beauty, shade thee home,<br>Its hundred ribs spread wide to throw<br>Splendour on thy fair head below?<br>Where are the royal fans, to grace<br>The lotus beauty of thy face,<br>Fair as the moon or wild-swan’s wing,<br>And waving round the new-made king?<br>Why do no sweet-toned bards rejoice<br>To hail thee with triumphant voice?<br>No tuneful heralds love to raise<br>Loud music in their monarch’s praise?<br>Why do no Bráhmans, Scripture-read,<br>Pour curds and honey on thy head,<br>Anointed, as the laws ordain,<br>With holy rites, supreme to reign?<br>Where are the chiefs of every guild?<br>Where are the myriads should have filled<br>The streets, and followed home their king<br>With merry noise and triumphing?<br>Why does no gold-wrought chariot lead<br>With four brave horses, best for speed?<br>No elephant precede the crowd<br>Like a huge hill or thunder cloud,<br>Marked from his birth for happy fate,<br>Whom signs auspicious decorate?<br>Why does no henchman, young and fair,<br>Precede thee, and delight to bear<br>Entrusted to his reverent hold<br>The burthen of thy throne of gold?<br>Why, if the consecrating rite<br>Be ready, why this mournful plight?<br>Why do I see this sudden change,<br>This altered mien so sad and strange?”<br><br>  To her, as thus she weeping cried,<br>Raghu’s illustrious son replied:<br>  “Sítá, my honoured sire’s decree<br>Commands me to the woods to flee.<br>O high-born lady, nobly bred<br>In the good paths thy footsteps tread,<br>Hear, Janak’s daughter, while I tell<br>The story as it all befell.<br>Of old my father true and brave<br>Two boons to Queen Kaikeyí gave.<br>Through these the preparations made<br>For me to-day by her are stayed,<br>For he is bound to disallow<br>This promise by that earlier vow.<br>In Daṇḍak forest wild and vast<br>Must fourteen years by me be passed.<br>My father’s will makes Bharat heir,<br>The kingdom and the throne to share.<br>Now, ere the lonely wild I seek,<br>I come once more with thee to speak.<br>In Bharat’s presence, O my dame,<br>Ne’er speak with pride of Ráma’s name:<br>Another’s eulogy to hear<br>Is hateful to a monarch’s ear.<br>Thou must with love his rule obey<br>To whom my father yields the sway.<br>With love and sweet observance learn<br>His grace, and more the king’s, to earn.<br>Now, that my father may not break<br>The words of promise that he spake,<br>To the drear wood my steps are bent:<br>Be firm, good Sítá, and content.<br>Through all that time, my blameless spouse,<br>Keep well thy fasts and holy vows.<br>Rise from thy bed at break of day,<br>And to the Gods due worship pay.<br>With meek and lowly love revere<br>The lord of men, my father dear,<br>And reverence to Kauśalyá show,<br>My mother, worn with eld and woe:<br>By duty’s law, O best of dames,<br>High worship from thy love she claims,<br>Nor to the other queens refuse<br>Observance, rendering each her dues:<br>By love and fond attention shown<br>They are my mothers like mine own.<br>Let Bharat and Śatrughna bear<br>In thy sweet love a special share:<br>Dear as my life, O let them be<br>Like brother and like son to thee.<br>In every word and deed refrain<br>From aught that Bharat’s soul may pain:<br>He is Ayodhyá’s king and mine,<br>The head and lord of all our line.<br>For those who serve and love them much<br>With weariless endeavour, touch<br>And win the gracious hearts of kings.<br>While wrath from disobedience springs.<br>Great monarchs from their presence send<br>Their lawful sons who still offend,<br>And welcome to the vacant place<br>Good children of an alien race.<br>Then, best of women, rest thou here,<br>And Bharat’s will with love revere.<br>Obedient to thy king remain,<br>And still thy vows of truth maintain.<br>  To the wide wood my steps I bend:<br>    Make thou thy dwelling here;<br>  See that thy conduct ne’er offend,<br>    And keep my words, my dear.”
