                            When those who forth with Ráma went<br>Back to the town their steps had bent,<br>It seemed that death had touched and chilled<br>Those hearts which piercing sorrow filled.<br>Each to his several mansion came,<br>And girt by children and his dame,<br>From his sad eyes the water shed<br>That o’er his cheek in torrents spread.<br>All joy was fled: oppressed with cares<br>No bustling trader showed his wares.<br>Each shop had lost its brilliant look,<br>Each householder forbore to cook.<br>No hand with joy its earnings told,<br>None cared to win a wealth of gold,<br>And scarce the youthful mother smiled<br>To see her first, her new-born child.<br>In every house a woman wailed,<br>And her returning lord assailed<br>With keen taunt piercing like the steel<br>That bids the tusked monster kneel:<br>“What now to them is wedded dame,<br>What house and home and dearest aim,<br>Or son, or bliss, or gathered store,<br>Whose eyes on Ráma look no more!<br>There is but one in all the earth,<br>One man alone of real worth,<br>Lakshmaṇ, who follows, true and good,<br>Ráma, with Sítá, through the wood.<br>Made holy for all time we deem<br>Each pool and fountain, lake and stream,<br>If great Kakutstha’s son shall choose<br>Their water for his bath to use.<br>Each forest, dark with lovely trees,<br>Shall yearn Kakutstha’s son to please;<br>Each mountain peak and woody hill,<br>Each mighty flood and mazy rill,<br>Each rocky height, each shady grove<br>Where the blest feet of Ráma rove,<br>Shall gladly welcome with the best<br>Of all they have their honoured guest.<br>The trees that clustering blossoms bear,<br>And bright-hued buds to gem their hair,<br>The heart of Ráma shall delight,<br>And cheer him on the breezy height.<br>For him the upland slopes will show<br>The fairest roots and fruit that grow,<br>And all their wealth before him fling<br>Ere the due hour of ripening.<br>For him each earth-upholding hill<br>Its crystal water shall distil,<br>And all its floods shall be displayed<br>In many a thousand-hued cascade.<br>Where Ráma stands is naught to fear,<br>No danger comes if he be near;<br>For all who live on him depend,<br>The world’s support, and lord, and friend.<br>Ere in too distant wilds he stray,<br>Let us to Ráma speed away,<br>For rich reward on those will wait<br>Who serve a prince of soul so great.<br>We will attend on Sítá there;<br>Be Raghu’s son your special care.”<br><br>The city dames, with grief distressed,<br>Thus once again their lords addressed:<br>“Ráma shall be your guard and guide,<br>And Sítá will for us provide.<br>For who would care to linger here,<br>Where all is sad and dark and drear?<br>Who, mid the mourners, hope for bliss<br>In a poor soulless town like this?<br>If Queen Kaikeyí’s treacherous sin,<br>Our lord expelled, the kingdom win,<br>We heed not sons or golden store,<br>Our life itself we prize no more.<br>If she, seduced by lust of sway,<br>Her lord and son could cast away,<br>Whom would she leave unharmed, the base<br>Defiler of her royal race?<br>We swear it by our children dear,<br>We will not dwell as servants here;<br>If Queen Kaikeyí live to reign,<br>We will not in her realm remain.<br>Bowed down by her oppressive hand,<br>The helpless, lordless, godless land,<br>Cursed for Kaikeyí’s guilt will fall,<br>And swift destruction seize it all.<br>For, Ráma forced from home to fly,<br>The king his sire will surely die,<br>And when the king has breathed his last<br>Ruin will doubtless follow fast.<br>Sad, robbed of merits, drug the cup<br>And drink the poisoned mixture up,<br>Or share the exiled Ráma’s lot,<br>Or seek some land that knows her not.<br>No reason, but a false pretence<br>Drove Ráma, Sítá, Lakshmaṇ hence,<br>And we to Bharat have been given<br>Like cattle to the shambles driven.”<br><br>  While in each house the women, pained<br>At loss of Ráma, still complained,<br>Sank to his rest the Lord of Day,<br>And night through all the sky held sway.<br>The fires of worship all were cold,<br>No text was hummed, no tale was told,<br>And shades of midnight gloom came down<br>Enveloping the mournful town.<br>Still, sick at heart, the women shed,<br>As for a son or husband fled,<br>For Ráma tears, disquieted:<br>  No child was loved as he.<br>And all Ayodhyá, where the feast,<br>Music, and song, and dance had ceased,<br>  And merriment and glee,<br>Where every merchant’s store was closed<br>That erst its glittering wares exposed,<br>  Was like a dried up sea.
