                            Śatrughna thus to Bharat spake<br>Who longed the forest road to take:<br>“He who in woe was wont to give<br>Strength to himself and all that live—<br>Dear Ráma, true and pure in heart,<br>Is banished by a woman’s art.<br>Yet here was Lakshmaṇ, brave and strong,<br>Could not his might prevent the wrong?<br>Could not his arm the king restrain,<br>Or make the banished free again?<br>One loving right and fearing crime<br>Had checked the monarch’s sin in time,<br>When, vassal of a woman’s will,<br>His feet approached the path of ill.”<br><br>  While Lakshmaṇ’s younger brother, dread<br>Śatrughna, thus to Bharat said,<br>Came to the fronting door, arrayed<br>In glittering robes, the hump-back maid.<br>There she, with sandal-oil besmeared,<br>In garments meet for queens appeared:<br>And lustre to her form was lent<br>By many a gem and ornament.<br>She girdled with her broidered zone,<br>And many a chain about her thrown,<br>Showed like a female monkey round<br>Whose body many a string is bound.<br>When on that cause of evil fell<br>The quick eye of the sentinel,<br>He grasped her in his ruthless hold,<br>And hastening in, Śatrughna told:<br>“Here is the wicked pest,” he cried,<br>“Through whom the king thy father died,<br>And Ráma wanders in the wood:<br>Do with her as thou deemest good.”<br>The warder spoke: and every word<br>Śatrughna’s breast to fury stirred:<br>He called the servants, all and each.<br>And spake in wrath his hasty speech:<br>“This is the wretch my sire who slew,<br>And misery on my brothers drew:<br>Let her this day obtain the meed,<br>Vile sinner, of her cruel deed.”<br>He spake; and moved by fury laid<br>His mighty hand upon the maid,<br>Who as her fellows ringed her round,<br>Made with her cries the hall resound.<br>Soon as the gathered women viewed<br>Śatrughna in his angry mood,<br>Their hearts disturbed by sudden dread,<br>They turned and from his presence fled.<br>“His rage,” they cried, “on us will fall,<br>And ruthless, he will slay us all.<br>Come, to Kauśalyá let us flee:<br>Our hope, our sure defence is she,<br>Approved by all, of virtuous mind,<br>Compassionate, and good, and kind.”<br><br>  His eyes with burning wrath aglow,<br>Śatrughna, shatterer of the foe,<br>Dragged on the ground the hump-back maid<br>Who shrieked aloud and screamed for aid.<br>This way and that with no remorse<br>He dragged her with resistless force,<br>And chains and glittering trinkets burst<br>Lay here and there with gems dispersed,<br>Till like the sky of Autumn shone<br>The palace floor they sparkled on.<br>The lord of men, supremely strong,<br>Haled in his rage the wretch along:<br>Where Queen Kaikeyí dwelt he came,<br>And sternly then addressed the dame.<br>Deep in her heart Kaikeyí felt<br>The stabs his keen reproaches dealt,<br>And of Śatrughna’s ire afraid,<br>To Bharat flew and cried for aid.<br>He looked and saw the prince inflamed<br>With burning rage, and thus exclaimed:<br>“Forgive! thine angry arm restrain:<br>A woman never may be slain.<br>My hand Kaikeyí’s blood would spill,<br>The sinner ever bent on ill,<br>But Ráma, long in duty tried,<br>Would hate the impious matricide:<br>And if he knew thy vengeful blade<br>Had slaughtered e’en this hump-back maid,<br>Never again, be sure, would he<br>Speak friendly word to thee or me.”<br><br>  When Bharat’s speech Śatrughna heard<br>He calmed the rage his breast that stirred,<br>Releasing from her dire constraint<br>The trembling wretch with terror faint.<br>Then to Kaikeyí’s feet she crept,<br>And prostrate in her misery wept.<br>Kaikeyí on the hump-back gazed,<br>  And saw her weep and gasp.<br>Still quivering, with her senses dazed,<br>  From fierce Śatrughna’s grasp.<br>With gentle words of pity she<br>  Assuaged her wild despair,<br>E’en as a tender hand might free<br>  A curlew from the snare.
