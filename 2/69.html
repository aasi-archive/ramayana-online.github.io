                            The night those messengers of state<br>Had past within the city’s gate,<br>In dreams the slumbering Bharat saw<br>A sight that chilled his soul with awe.<br>The dream that dire events foretold<br>Left Bharat’s heart with horror cold,<br>And with consuming woes distraught,<br>Upon his aged sire he thought.<br>His dear companions, swift to trace<br>The signs of anguish on his face,<br>Drew near, his sorrow to expel,<br>And pleasant tales began to tell.<br>Some woke sweet music’s cheering sound,<br>And others danced in lively round.<br>With joke and jest they strove to raise<br>His spirits, quoting ancient plays;<br>But Bharat still, the lofty-souled,<br>Deaf to sweet tales his fellows told,<br>Unmoved by music, dance, and jest,<br>Sat silent, by his woe oppressed.<br>To him, begirt by comrades near,<br>Thus spoke the friend he held most dear:<br>“Why ringed around by friends, art thou<br>So silent and so mournful now?”<br>“Hear thou,” thus Bharat made reply,<br>“What chills my heart and dims mine eye.<br>I dreamt I saw the king my sire<br>Sink headlong in a lake of mire<br>Down from a mountain high in air,<br>His body soiled, and loose his hair.<br>Upon the miry lake he seemed<br>To lie and welter, as I dreamed;<br>With hollowed hands full many a draught<br>Of oil he took, and loudly laughed.<br>With head cast down I saw him make<br>A meal on sesamum and cake;<br>The oil from every member dripped,<br>And in its clammy flood he dipped.<br>The ocean’s bed was bare and dry,<br>The moon had fallen from the sky,<br>And all the world lay still and dead,<br>With whelming darkness overspread.<br>The earth was rent and opened wide,<br>The leafy trees were scorched, and died;<br>I saw the seated mountains split,<br>And wreaths of rising smoke emit.<br>The stately beast the monarch rode<br>His long tusks rent and splintered showed;<br>And flames that quenched and cold had lain<br>Blazed forth with kindled light again.<br>I looked, and many a handsome dame,<br>Arrayed in brown and sable came<br>And bore about the monarch, dressed,<br>On iron stool, in sable vest.<br>And then the king, of virtuous mind,<br>A blood-red wreath around him twined,<br>Forth on an ass-drawn chariot sped,<br>As southward still he bent his head.<br>Then, crimson-clad, a dame appeared<br>Who at the monarch laughed and jeered;<br>And a she-monster, dire to view,<br>Her hand upon his body threw.<br>Such is the dream I dreamt by night,<br>Which chills me yet with wild affright:<br>Either the king or Ráma, I<br>Or Lakshmaṇ now must surely die.<br>For when an ass-drawn chariot seems<br>To bear away a man in dreams,<br>Be sure above his funeral pyre<br>The smoke soon rears its cloudy spire.<br>This makes my spirit low and weak,<br>My tongue is slow and loth to speak:<br>My lips and throat are dry for dread,<br>And all my soul disquieted.<br>My lips, relaxed, can hardly speak,<br>And chilling dread has changed my cheek<br>I blame myself in aimless fears,<br>And still no cause of blame appears.<br>I dwell upon this dream of ill<br>    Whose changing scenes I viewed,<br>  And on the startling horror still<br>    My troubled thoughts will brood.<br>  Still to my soul these terrors cling,<br>    Reluctant to depart,<br>  And the strange vision of the king<br>    Still weighs upon my heart.”
