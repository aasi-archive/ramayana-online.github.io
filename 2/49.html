                            Now Ráma, ere the night was fled,<br>O’er many a league of road had sped,<br>Till, as his course he onward held,<br>The morn the shades of night dispelled.<br>The rites of holy dawn he paid,<br>And all the country round surveyed.<br>He saw, as still he hurried through<br>With steeds which swift as arrows flew,<br>Hamlets and groves with blossoms fair,<br>And fields which showed the tillers’ care,<br>While from the clustered dwellings near<br>The words of peasants reached his ear:<br>“Fie on our lord the king, whose soul<br>Is yielded up to love’s control!<br>Fie on the vile Kaikeyí! Shame<br>On that malicious sinful dame,<br>Who, keenly bent on cruel deeds,<br>No bounds of right and virtue heeds,<br>But with her wicked art has sent<br>So good a prince to banishment,<br>Wise, tender-hearted, ruling well<br>His senses, in the woods to dwell.<br>Ah cruel king! his heart of steel<br>For his own son no love could feel,<br>Who with the sinless Ráma parts,<br>The darling of the people’s hearts.”<br><br>  These words he heard the peasants say,<br>Who dwelt in hamlets by the way,<br>And, lord of all the realm by right,<br>Through Kośala pursued his flight.<br>Through the auspicious flood, at last,<br>Of Vedaśrutí’s stream he passed,<br>And onward to the place he sped<br>By Saint Agastya tenanted.<br>Still on for many an hour he hied,<br>And crossed the stream whose cooling tide<br>Rolls onward till she meets the sea,<br>The herd-frequented Gomatí.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Known to Europeans as the Goomtee.
