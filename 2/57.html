                            When Ráma reached the southern bank,<br>King Guha’s heart with sorrow sank:<br>He with Sumantra talked, and spent<br>With his deep sorrow, homeward went.<br>Sumantra, as the king decreed,<br>Yoked to the car each noble steed,<br>And to Ayodhyá’s city sped<br>With his sad heart disquieted.<br>On lake and brook and scented grove<br>His glances fell, as on he drove:<br>City and village came in view<br>As o’er the road his coursers flew.<br>On the third day the charioteer,<br>When now the hour of night was near,<br>Came to Ayodhyá’s gate, and found<br>The city all in sorrow drowned.<br>To him, in spirit quite cast down,<br>Forsaken seemed the silent town,<br>And by the rush of grief oppressed<br>He pondered in his mournful breast:<br>“Is all Ayodhyá burnt with grief,<br>Steed, elephant, and man, and chief?<br>Does her loved Ráma’s exile so<br>Afflict her with the fires of woe?”<br>Thus as he mused, his steeds flew fast,<br>And swiftly through the gate he passed.<br>On drove the charioteer, and then<br>In hundreds, yea in thousands, men<br>Ran to the car from every side,<br>And, “Ráma, where is Ráma?” cried.<br>Sumantra said: “My chariot bore<br>The duteous prince to Gangá’s shore;<br>I left him there at his behest,<br>And homeward to Ayodhyá pressed.”<br>Soon as the anxious people knew<br>That he was o’er the flood they drew<br>Deep sighs, and crying, Ráma! all<br>Wailed, and big tears began to fall.<br>He heard the mournful words prolonged,<br>As here and there the people thronged:<br>“Woe, woe for us, forlorn, undone,<br>No more to look on Raghu’s son!<br>His like again we ne’er shall see,<br>Of heart so true, of hand so free,<br>In gifts, in gatherings for debate,<br>When marriage pomps we celebrate,<br>What should we do? What earthly thing<br>Can rest, or hope, or pleasure bring?”<br><br>  Thus the sad town, which Ráma kept<br>As a kind father, wailed and wept.<br>Each mansion, as the car went by,<br>Sent forth a loud and bitter cry,<br>As to the window every dame,<br>Mourning for banished Ráma, came.<br>As his sad eyes with tears o’erflowed,<br>He sped along the royal road<br>To Daśaratha’s high abode.<br>There leaping down his car he stayed;<br>Within the gates his way he made;<br>Through seven broad courts he onward hied<br>Where people thronged on every side.<br>From each high terrace, wild with woe,<br>The royal ladies flocked below:<br>He heard them talk in gentle tone,<br>As each for Ráma made her moan:<br>“What will the charioteer reply<br>To Queen Kauśalyá’s eager cry?<br>With Ráma from the gates he went;<br>Homeward alone, his steps are bent.<br>Hard is a life with woe distressed,<br>But difficult to win is rest,<br>If, when her son is banished, still<br>She lives beneath her load of ill.”<br><br>  Such was the speech Sumantra heard<br>From them whom grief unfeigned had stirred.<br>As fires of anguish burnt him through,<br>Swift to the monarch’s hall he drew,<br>Past the eighth court; there met his sight,<br>The sovereign in his palace bright,<br>Still weeping for his son, forlorn,<br>Pale, faint, and all with sorrow worn.<br>As there he sat, Sumantra bent<br>And did obeisance reverent,<br>And to the king repeated o’er<br>The message he from Ráma bore.<br>The monarch heard, and well-nigh brake<br>His heart, but yet no word he spake:<br>Fainting to earth he fell, and dumb,<br>By grief for Ráma overcome.<br>Rang through the hall a startling cry,<br>And women’s arms were tossed on high,<br>When, with his senses all astray,<br>Upon the ground the monarch lay.<br>Kauśalyá, with Sumitrá’s aid,<br>Raised from the ground her lord dismayed:<br>“Sire, of high fate,” she cried, “O, why<br>Dost thou no single word reply<br>To Ráma’s messenger who brings<br>News of his painful wanderings?<br>The great injustice done, art thou<br>Shame-stricken for thy conduct now?<br>Rise up, and do thy part: bestow<br>Comfort and help in this our woe.<br>Speak freely, King; dismiss thy fear,<br>For Queen Kaikeyí stands not near,<br>Afraid of whom thou wouldst not seek<br>Tidings of Ráma: freely speak.”<br><br>  When the sad queen had ended so,<br>She sank, insatiate in her woe,<br>And prostrate lay upon the ground,<br>While her faint voice by sobs was drowned.<br>When all the ladies in despair<br>Saw Queen Kauśalyá wailing there,<br>And the poor king oppressed with pain,<br>They flocked around and wept again.
