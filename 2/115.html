                            Then when the pious chief had seen<br>Lodged in her home each widowed queen,<br>Still with his burning grief oppressed<br>His holy guides he thus addressed:<br>“I go to Nandigrám: adieu,<br>This day, my lords to all of you:<br>I go, my load of grief to bear,<br>Reft of the son of Raghu, there.<br>The king my sire, alas, is dead,<br>And Ráma to the forest fled;<br>There will I wait till he, restored,<br>Shall rule the realm, its rightful lord.”<br><br>  They heard the high-souled prince’s speech,<br>And thus with ready answer each<br>Of those great lords their chief addressed,<br>With saint Vaśishṭha and the rest:<br>“Good are the words which thou hast said,<br>By brotherly affection led,<br>Like thine own self, a faithful friend,<br>True to thy brother to the end:<br>A heart like thine must all approve,<br>Which naught from virtue’s path can move.”<br><br>  Soon as the words he loved to hear<br>Fell upon Bharat’s joyful ear,<br>Thus to the charioteer he spoke:<br>“My car with speed, Sumantra, yoke.”<br>Then Bharat with delighted mien<br>Obeisance paid to every queen,<br>And with Śatrughna by his side<br>Mounting the car away he hied.<br>With lords, and priests in long array<br>The brothers hastened on their way.<br>And the great pomp the Bráhmans led<br>With Saint Vaśishṭha at their head.<br>Then every face was eastward bent<br>As on to Nandigrám they went.<br>Behind the army followed, all<br>Unsummoned by their leader’s call,<br>And steeds and elephants and men<br>Streamed forth with every citizen.<br>As Bharat in his chariot rode<br>His heart with love fraternal glowed,<br>And with the sandals on his head<br>To Nandigrám he quickly sped.<br>Within the town he swiftly pressed,<br>Alighted, and his guides addressed:<br>“To me in trust my brother’s hand<br>Consigned the lordship of the land,<br>When he these gold-wrought sandals gave<br>As emblems to protect and save.”<br>Then Bharat bowed, and from his head<br>The sacred pledge deposited,<br>And thus to all the people cried<br>Who ringed him round on every side:<br>“Haste, for these sandals quickly bring<br>The canopy that shades the king.<br>Pay ye to them all reverence meet<br>As to my elder brother’s feet,<br>For they will right and law maintain<br>Until King Ráma come again.<br>My brother with a loving mind<br>These sandals to my charge consigned:<br>I till he come will guard with care<br>The sacred trust for Raghu’s heir.<br>My watchful task will soon be done,<br>The pledge restored to Raghu’s son;<br>Then shall I see, his wanderings o’er,<br>These sandals on his feet once more.<br>My brother I shall meet at last,<br>The burthen from my shoulders cast,<br>To Ráma’s hand the realm restore<br>And serve my elder as before.<br>When Ráma takes again this pair<br>Of sandals kept with pious care,<br>And here his glorious reign begins,<br>I shall be cleansed from all my sins,<br>When the glad people’s voices ring<br>With welcome to the new-made king,<br>Joy will be mine four-fold as great<br>As if supreme I ruled the state.”<br><br>  Thus humbly spoke in sad lament<br>The chief in fame preëminent:<br>Thus, by his reverent lords obeyed,<br>At Nandigrám the kingdom swayed.<br>With hermit’s dress and matted hair<br>He dwelt with all his army there.<br>The sandals of his brother’s feet<br>Installed upon the royal seat,<br>He, all his powers to them referred,<br>Affairs of state administered.<br>  In every care, in every task,<br>    When golden store was brought,<br>  He first, as though their rede to ask,<br>    Those royal sandals sought.
