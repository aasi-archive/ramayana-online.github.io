                            When Ráma, chief of Raghu’s race,<br>Arrived at that delightful place,<br>He looked on Sítá first, and then<br>To Lakshmaṇ spake the lord of men:<br>“Now first the shades of night descend<br>Since to the wilds our steps we bend.<br>Joy to thee, brother! do not grieve<br>For our dear home and all we leave.<br>The woods unpeopled seem to weep<br>Around us, as their tenants creep<br>Or fly to lair and den and nest,<br>Both bird and beast, to seek their rest.<br>Methinks Ayodhyá’s royal town<br>Where dwells my sire of high renown,<br>With all her men and dames to-night<br>Will mourn us vanished from their sight.<br>For, by his virtues won, they cling<br>In fond affection to their king,<br>And thee and me, O brave and true,<br>And Bharat and Śatrughna too.<br>I for my sire and mother feel<br>Deep sorrow o’er my bosom steal,<br>Lest mourning us, oppressed with fears,<br>They blind their eyes with endless tears.<br>Yet Bharat’s duteous love will show<br>Sweet comfort in their hours of woe,<br>And with kind words their hearts sustain,<br>Suggesting duty, bliss, and gain.<br>I mourn my parents now no more:<br>I count dear Bharat’s virtues o’er,<br>And his kind love and care dispel<br>The doubts I had, and all is well.<br>And thou thy duty wouldst not shun,<br>And, following me, hast nobly done;<br>Else, bravest, I should need a band<br>Around my wife as guard to stand.<br>On this first night, my thirst to slake,<br>Some water only will I take:<br>Thus, brother, thus my will decides,<br>Though varied store the wood provides.”<br><br>  Thus having said to Lakshmaṇ, he<br>Addressed in turn Sumantra: “Be<br>Most diligent to-night, my friend,<br>And with due care thy horses tend.”<br>The sun had set: Sumantra tied<br>His noble horses side by side,<br>Gave store of grass with liberal hand,<br>And rested near them on the strand.<br>Each paid the holy evening rite,<br>And when around them fell the night,<br>The charioteer, with Lakshmaṇ’s aid,<br>A lowly bed for Ráma laid.<br>To Lakshmaṇ Ráma bade adieu,<br>And then by Sítá’s side he threw<br>His limbs upon the leafy bed<br>Their care upon the bank had spread.<br>When Lakshmaṇ saw the couple slept,<br>Still on the strand his watch he kept,<br>Still with Sumantra there conversed,<br>And Ráma’s varied gifts rehearsed.<br>All night he watched, nor sought repose,<br>Till on the earth the sun arose:<br>With him Sumantra stayed awake,<br>And still of Ráma’s virtues spake.<br>Thus, near the river’s grassy shore<br>Which herds unnumbered wandered o’er,<br>Repose, untroubled, Ráma found,<br>And all the people lay around.<br>The glorious hero left his bed,<br>Looked on the sleeping crowd, and said<br>To Lakshmaṇ, whom each lucky line<br>Marked out for bliss with surest sign:<br><br>  “O brother Lakshmaṇ, look on these<br>Reclining at the roots of trees;<br>All care of house and home resigned,<br>Caring for us with heart and mind,<br>These people of the city yearn<br>To see us to our home return:<br>To quit their lives will they consent,<br>But never leave their firm intent.<br>Come, while they all unconscious sleep,<br>Let us upon the chariot leap,<br>And swiftly on our journey speed<br>Where naught our progress may impede,<br>That these fond citizens who roam<br>Far from Ikshváku’s ancient home,<br>No more may sleep ’neath bush and tree,<br>Following still for love of me.<br>A prince with tender care should heal<br>The self-brought woes his people feel,<br>And never let his subjects share<br>The burthen he is forced to bear.”<br><br>  Then Lakshmaṇ to the chief replied,<br>Who stood like Justice by his side:<br>“Thy rede, O sage, I well commend:<br>Without delay the car ascend.”<br>Then Ráma to Sumantra spoke:<br>“Thy rapid steeds, I pray thee, yoke.<br>Hence to the forest will I go:<br>Away, my lord, and be not slow.”<br><br>  Sumantra, urged to utmost speed,<br>Yoked to the car each generous steed,<br>And then, with hand to hand applied,<br>He came before the chief and cried:<br>“Hail, Prince, whom mighty arms adorn,<br>Hail, bravest of the chariot-borne!<br>With Sítá and thy brother thou<br>Mayst mount: the car is ready now.”<br><br>  The hero clomb the car with haste:<br>His bow and gear within were placed,<br>And quick the eddying flood he passed<br>Of Tamasá whose waves run fast.<br>Soon as he touched the farther side,<br>That strong-armed hero, glorified,<br>He found a road both wide and clear,<br>Where e’en the timid naught could fear.<br>Then, that the crowd might be misled,<br>Thus Ráma to Sumantra said:<br>“Speed north a while, then hasten back,<br>Returning in thy former track,<br>That so the people may not learn<br>The course I follow: drive and turn.”<br><br>  Sumantra, at the chief’s behest,<br>Quick to the task himself addressed;<br>Then near to Ráma came, and showed<br>The chariot ready for the road.<br>With Sítá, then, the princely two,<br>Who o’er the line of Raghu threw<br>A glory ever bright and new,<br>  Upon the chariot stood.<br>Sumantra fast and faster drove<br>His horses, who in fleetness strove<br>Still onward to the distant grove,<br>  The hermit-haunted wood.
