                            That speech of Guha Bharat heard<br>With grief and tender pity stirred,<br>And as his ears the story drank,<br>Deep in his thoughtful heart it sank.<br>His large full eyes in anguish rolled,<br>His trembling limbs grew stiff and cold;<br>Then fell he, like a tree uptorn,<br>In woe too grievous to be borne.<br>When Guha saw the long-armed chief<br>Whose eye was like a lotus leaf,<br>With lion shoulders strong and fair,<br>High-mettled, prostrate in despair,—<br>Pale, bitterly afflicted, he<br>Reeled as in earthquake reels a tree.<br>But when Śatrughna standing nigh<br>Saw his dear brother helpless lie,<br>Distraught with woe his head he bowed,<br>Embraced him oft and wept aloud.<br>Then Bharat’s mothers came, forlorn<br>Of their dear king, with fasting worn,<br>And stood with weeping eyes around<br>The hero prostrate on the ground.<br>Kauśalyá, by her woe oppressed,<br>The senseless Bharat’s limbs caressed,<br>As a fond cow in love and fear<br>Caresses oft her youngling dear:<br>Then yielding to her woe she said,<br>Weeping and sore disquieted:<br>“What torments, O my son, are these<br>Of sudden pain or swift disease?<br>The lives of us and all the line<br>Depend, dear child, on only thine.<br>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ forced to flee,<br>I live by naught but seeing thee:<br>For as the king has past away<br>Thou art my only help to-day.<br>Hast thou, perchance, heard evil news<br>Of Lakshmaṇ, which thy soul subdues,<br>Or Ráma dwelling with his spouse—<br>My all is he—neath forest boughs?”<br><br>  Then slowly gathering sense and strength<br>The weeping hero rose at length,<br>And words like these to Guha spake,<br>That bade Kauśalyá comfort take:<br>“Where lodged the prince that night? and where<br>Lakshmaṇ the brave, and Sítá fair?<br>Show me the couch whereon he lay,<br>Tell me the food he ate, I pray.”<br><br>  Then Guha the Nishádas’ king<br>Replied to Bharat’s questioning:<br>“Of all I had I brought the best<br>To serve my good and honoured guest<br>Food of each varied kind I chose,<br>And every fairest fruit that grows.<br>Ráma the hero truly brave<br>Declined the gift I humbly gave:<br>His Warrior part he ne’er forgot,<br>And what I brought accepted not:<br>“No gifts, my friend, may we accept:<br>Our law is, Give, and must be kept.”<br>The high-souled chief, O Monarch, thus<br>With gracious words persuaded us.<br>Then calm and still, absorbed in thought,<br>He drank the water Lakshmaṇ brought,<br>And then, obedient to his vows,<br>He fasted with his gentle spouse.<br>So Lakshmaṇ too from food abstained,<br>And sipped the water that remained:<br>Then with ruled lips, devoutly staid,<br>The three<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, and Sumantra.

</span></span> their evening worship paid.<br>Then Lakshmaṇ with unwearied care<br>Brought heaps of sacred grass, and there<br>With his own hands he quickly spread,<br>For Ráma’s rest, a pleasant bed,<br>And faithful Sítá’s too, where they<br>Reclining each by other lay.<br>Then Lakshmaṇ bathed their feet, and drew<br>A little distance from the two.<br>Here stands the tree which lent them shade,<br>Here is the grass beneath it laid,<br>Where Ráma and his consort spent<br>The night together ere they went.<br>Lakshmaṇ, whose arms the foeman quell,<br>Watched all the night as sentinel,<br>  And kept his great bow strung:<br>His hand was gloved, his arm was braced,<br>Two well-filled quivers at his waist,<br>  With deadly arrows, hung.<br>I took my shafts and trusty bow,<br>And with that tamer of the foe<br>  Stood ever wakeful near,<br>And with my followers, bow in hand,<br>Behind me ranged, a ready band,<br>  Kept watch o’er Indra’s peer.”
