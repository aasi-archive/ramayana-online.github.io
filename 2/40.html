                            Then Ráma, Sítá, Lakshmaṇ bent<br>At the king’s feet, and sadly went<br>Round him with slow steps reverent.<br>When Ráma of the duteous heart<br>Had gained his sire’s consent to part,<br>With Sítá by his side he paid<br>Due reverence to the queen dismayed.<br>And Lakshmaṇ, with affection meet,<br>Bowed down and clasped his mother’s feet.<br>Sumitrá viewed him as he pressed<br>Her feet, and thus her son addressed:<br>“Neglect not Ráma wandering there,<br>But tend him with thy faithful care.<br>In hours of wealth, in time of woe,<br>Him, sinless son, thy refuge know.<br>From this good law the just ne’er swerve,<br>That younger sons the eldest serve,<br>And to this righteous rule incline<br>All children of thine ancient line—<br>Freely to give, reward each rite,<br>Nor spare their bodies in the fight.<br>Let Ráma Daśaratha be,<br>Look upon Sítá as on me,<br>And let the cot wherein you dwell<br>Be thine Ayodhyá. Fare thee well.”<br>Her blessing thus Sumitrá gave<br>To him whose soul to Ráma clave,<br>Exclaiming, when her speech was done,<br>“Go forth, O Lakshmaṇ, go, my son.<br>Go forth, my son to win success,<br>High victory and happiness.<br>Go forth thy foemen to destroy,<br>And turn again at last with joy.”<br><br>  As Mátali his charioteer<br>Speaks for the Lord of Gods to hear,<br>Sumantra, palm to palm applied,<br>In reverence trained, to Ráma cried:<br>“O famous Prince, my car ascend,—<br>May blessings on thy course attend,—<br>And swiftly shall my horses flee<br>And place thee where thou biddest me.<br>The fourteen years thou hast to stay<br>Far in the wilds, begin to-day;<br>For Oueen Kaikeyí cries, Away.”<br><br>  Then Sítá, best of womankind,<br>Ascended, with a tranquil mind,<br>Soon as her toilet task was done,<br>That chariot brilliant as the sun.<br>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ true and bold<br>Sprang on the car adorned with gold.<br>The king those years had counted o’er,<br>And given Sítá robes and store<br>Of precious ornaments to wear<br>When following her husband there.<br>The brothers in the car found place<br>For nets and weapons of the chase,<br>There warlike arms and mail they laid,<br>A leathern basket and a spade.<br>Soon as Sumantra saw the three<br>Were seated in the chariot, he<br>Urged on each horse of noble breed,<br>Who matched the rushing wind in speed.<br>As thus the son of Raghu went<br>Forth for his dreary banishment,<br>Chill numbing grief the town assailed,<br>All strength grew weak, all spirit failed,<br>Ayodhyá through her wide extent<br>Was filled with tumult and lament:<br>Steeds neighed and shook the bells they bore,<br>Each elephant returned a roar.<br>Then all the city, young and old,<br>Wild with their sorrow uncontrolled,<br>Rushed to the car, as, from the sun<br>The panting herds to water run.<br>Before the car, behind, they clung,<br>And there as eagerly they hung,<br>With torrents streaming from their eyes,<br>Called loudly with repeated cries:<br>“Listen, Sumantra: draw thy rein;<br>Drive gently, and thy steeds restrain.<br>Once more on Ráma will we gaze,<br>Now to be lost for many days.<br>The queen his mother has, be sure,<br>A heart of iron, to endure<br>To see her godlike Ráma go,<br>Nor feel it shattered by the blow.<br>Sítá, well done! Videha’s pride,<br>Still like his shadow by his side;<br>Rejoicing in thy duty still<br>As sunlight cleaves to Meru’s hill.<br>Thou, Lakshmaṇ, too, hast well deserved,<br>Who from thy duty hast not swerved,<br>Tending the peer of Gods above,<br>Whose lips speak naught but words of love.<br>Thy firm resolve is nobly great,<br>And high success on thee shall wait.<br>Yea, thou shalt win a priceless meed—<br>Thy path with him to heaven shall lead.”<br>As thus they spake, they could not hold<br>The tears that down their faces rolled,<br>While still they followed for a space<br>Their darling of Ikshváku’s race.<br><br>  There stood surrounded by a ring<br>Of mournful wives the mournful king;<br>For, “I will see once more,” he cried,<br>“Mine own dear son,” and forth he hied.<br>As he came near, there rose the sound<br>Of weeping, as the dames stood round.<br>So the she-elephants complain<br>When their great lord and guide is slain.<br>Kakutstha’s son, the king of men,<br>The glorious sire, looked troubled then,<br>As the full moon is when dismayed<br>By dark eclipse’s threatening shade.<br>Then Daśaratha’s son, designed<br>For highest fate of lofty mind,<br>Urged to more speed the charioteer,<br>“Away, away! why linger here?<br>Urge on thy horses,” Rama cried,<br>And “Stay, O stay,” the people sighed.<br>Sumantra, urged to speed away,<br>The townsmen’s call must disobey,<br>Forth as the long-armed hero went,<br>The dust his chariot wheels up sent<br>Was laid by streams that ever flowed<br>From their sad eyes who filled the road.<br>Then, sprung of woe, from eyes of all<br>The women drops began to fall,<br>As from each lotus on the lake<br>The darting fish the water shake.<br>When he, the king of high renown,<br>Saw that one thought held all the town,<br>Like some tall tree he fell and lay,<br>Whose root the axe has hewn away.<br>Then straight a mighty cry from those<br>Who followed Ráma’s car arose,<br>Who saw their monarch fainting there<br>Beneath that grief too great to bear.<br>Then “Ráma, Ráma!” with the cry<br>Of “Ah, his mother!” sounded high,<br>As all the people wept aloud<br>Around the ladies’ sorrowing crowd.<br>When Ráma backward turned his eye,<br>And saw the king his father lie<br>With troubled sense and failing limb,<br>And the sad queen, who followed him,<br>Like some young creature in the net,<br>That will not, in its misery, let<br>Its wild eyes on its mother rest,<br>So, by the bonds of duty pressed,<br>His mother’s look he could not meet.<br>He saw them with their weary feet,<br>Who, used to bliss, in cars should ride,<br>Who ne’er by sorrow should be tried,<br>And, as one mournful look he cast,<br>“Drive on,” he cried, “Sumantra, fast.”<br>As when the driver’s torturing hook<br>Goads on an elephant, the look<br>Of sire and mother in despair<br>Was more than Ráma’s heart could bear.<br>As mother kine to stalls return<br>Which hold the calves for whom they yearn,<br>So to the car she tried to run<br>As a cow seeks her little one.<br>Once and again the hero’s eyes<br>Looked on his mother, as with cries<br>Of woe she called and gestures wild,<br>“O Sítá, Lakshmaṇ, O my child!”<br>“Stay,” cried the king, “thy chariot stay:”<br>“On, on,” cried Ráma, “speed away.”<br>As one between two hosts, inclined<br>To neither was Sumantra’s mind.<br>But Ráma spake these words again:<br>“A lengthened woe is bitterest pain.<br>On, on; and if his wrath grow hot,<br>Thine answer be, ‘I heard thee not.’ ”<br>Sumantra, at the chief’s behest,<br>Dismissed the crowd that toward him pressed,<br>And, as he bade, to swiftest speed<br>Urged on his way each willing steed.<br>The king’s attendants parted thence,<br>And paid him heart-felt reverence:<br>In mind, and with the tears he wept,<br>Each still his place near Ráma kept.<br>As swift away the horses sped,<br>His lords to Daśaratha said:<br>“To follow him whom thou again<br>Wouldst see returning home is vain.”<br>  With failing limb and drooping mien<br>    He heard their counsel wise:<br>  Still on their son the king and queen<br>    Kept fast their lingering eyes.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">“Thirty centuries have passed since he began this memorable journey.
Every step of it is known and is annually traversed by thousands:
hero worship is not extinct. What can Faith do! How strong are the
ties of religion when entwined with the legends of a country! How
many a cart creeps creaking and weary along the road from Ayodhyá to
Chitrakúṭ. It is this that gives the Rámáyan a strange interest, the
story still lives.”<em>&nbsp;Calcutta Review: Vol. XXIII.</em>
