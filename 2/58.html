                            The king a while had senseless lain,<br>When care brought memory back again.<br>Then straight he called, the news to hear<br>Of Ráma, for the charioteer,<br>With reverent hand to hand applied<br>He waited by the old man’s side,<br>Whose mind with anguish was distraught<br>Like a great elephant newly caught.<br>The king with bitter pain distressed<br>The faithful charioteer addressed,<br>Who, sad of mien, with flooded eye,<br>And dust upon his limbs, stood by:<br>“Where will be Ráma’s dwelling now<br>At some tree’s foot, beneath the bough;<br>Ah, what will be the exile’s food,<br>Bred up with kind solicitude?<br>Can he, long lapped in pleasant rest,<br>Unmeet for pain, by pain oppressed,<br>Son of earth’s king, his sad night spend<br>Earth-couched, as one that has no friend?<br>Behind him, when abroad he sped,<br>Cars, elephant, and foot were led:<br>Then how shall Ráma dwell afar<br>In the wild woods where no men are?<br>How, tell me, did the princes there,<br>With Sítá good and soft and fair,<br>Alighting from the chariot, tread<br>The forest wilds around them spread?<br>A happy lot is thine, I ween,<br>Whose eyes my two dear sons have seen<br>Seeking on foot the forest shade,<br>Like the bright Twins to view displayed,<br>The heavenly Aśvins, when they seek<br>The woods that hang ’neath Mandar’s peak.<br>What words, Sumantra, quickly tell,<br>From Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, Sítá fell?<br>How in the wood did Ráma eat?<br>What was his bed, and what his seat?<br>Full answer to my questions give,<br>For I on thy replies shall live,<br>As with the saints Yayáti held<br>Sweet converse, from the skies expelled.”<br><br>  Urged by the lord of men to speak,<br>Whose sobbing voice came faint and weak,<br>Thus he, while tears his utterance broke,<br>In answer to the monarch spoke:<br>“Hear then the words that Ráma said,<br>Resolved in duty’s path to tread.<br>Joining his hands, his head he bent,<br>And gave this message, reverent:<br>“Sumantra, to my father go,<br>Whose lofty mind all people know:<br>Bow down before him, as is meet,<br>And in my stead salute his feet.<br>Then to the queen my mother bend,<br>And give the greeting that I send:<br>Ne’er may her steps from duty err,<br>And may it still be well with her.<br>And add this word: “O Queen, pursue<br>Thy vows with faithful heart and true;<br>And ever at due season turn<br>Where holy fires of worship burn.<br>And, lady, on our lord bestow<br>Such honour as to Gods we owe.<br>Be kind to every queen: let pride<br>And thought of self be cast aside.<br>In the king’s fond opinion raise<br>Kaikeyí, by respect and praise.<br>Let the young Bharat ever be<br>Loved, honoured as the king by thee:<br>Thy king-ward duty ne’er forget:<br>High over all are monarchs set.”<br><br>  And Bharat, too, for me address:<br>Pray that all health his life may bless.<br>Let every royal lady share,<br>As justice bids, his love and care.<br>Say to the strong-armed chief who brings<br>Joy to Iksváku’s line of kings:<br>“As ruling prince thy care be shown<br>Of him, our sire, who holds the throne.<br>Stricken in years he feels their weight;<br>But leave him in his royal state.<br>As regent heir content thee still,<br>Submissive to thy father’s will.’ ”<br>Ráma again his charge renewed,<br>As the hot flood his cheek bedewed:<br>“Hold as thine own my mother dear<br>Who drops for me the longing tear.”<br>Then Lakshmaṇ, with his soul on fire,<br>Spake breathing fast these words of ire:<br>“Say, for what sin, for what offence<br>Was royal Ráma banished thence?<br>He is the cause, the king: poor slave<br>To the light charge Kaikeyí gave.<br>Let right or wrong the motive be,<br>The author of our woe is he.<br>Whether the exile were decreed<br>Through foolish faith or guilty greed,<br>For promises or empire, still<br>The king has wrought a grievous ill.<br>Grant that the Lord of all saw fit<br>To prompt the deed and sanction it,<br>In Ráma’s life no cause I see<br>For which the king should bid him flee.<br>His blinded eyes refused to scan<br>The guilt and folly of the plan,<br>And from the weakness of the king<br>Here and hereafter woe shall spring.<br>No more my sire: the ties that used<br>To bind me to the king are loosed.<br>My brother Ráma, Raghu’s son,<br>To me is lord, friend, sire in one.<br>The love of men how can he win,<br>Deserting, by the cruel sin,<br>Their joy, whose heart is swift to feel<br>A pleasure in the people’s weal?<br>Shall he whose mandate could expel<br>The virtuous Ráma, loved so well,<br>To whom his subjects’ fond hearts cling—<br>Shall he in spite of them be king?”<br><br>  But Janak’s child, my lord, stood by,<br>And oft the votaress heaved a sigh.<br>She seemed with dull and wandering sense,<br>Beneath a spirit’s influence.<br>The noble princess, pained with woe<br>Which till that hour she ne’er could know,<br>Tears in her heavy trouble shed,<br>But not a word to me she said.<br>She raised her face which grief had dried<br>And tenderly her husband eyed,<br>Gazed on him as he turned to go<br>While tear chased tear in rapid flow.”
