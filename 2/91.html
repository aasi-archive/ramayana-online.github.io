                            Soon as he saw the prince’s mind<br>To rest that day was well inclined,<br>He sought Kaikeyí’s son to please<br>With hospitable courtesies.<br>Then Bharat to the saint replied:<br>“Our wants are more than satisfied.<br>The gifts which honoured strangers greet,<br>And water for our weary feet<br>Hast thou bestowed with friendly care,<br>And every choice of woodland fare.”<br><br>  Then Bharadvája spoke, a smile<br>Playing upon his lips the while:<br>“I know, dear Prince, thy friendly mind<br>Will any fare sufficient find,<br>But gladly would I entertain<br>And banquet all thine armed train:<br>Such is my earnest wish: do thou<br>This longing of my heart allow,<br>Why hast thou hither bent thy way,<br>And made thy troops behind thee stay?<br>Why unattended? couldst thou not<br>With friends and army seek this spot?”<br><br>  Bharat, with reverent hands raised high,<br>To that great hermit made reply:<br>“My troops, for awe of thee, O Sage,<br>I brought not to thy hermitage:<br>Troops of a king or monarch’s son<br>A hermit’s home should ever shun.<br>Behind me comes a mighty train<br>Wide spreading o’er the ample plain,<br>Where every chief and captain leads<br>Men, elephants, and mettled steeds.<br>I feared, O reverend Sage, lest these<br>Might harm the holy ground and trees,<br>Springs might be marred and cots o’erthrown,<br>So with the priests I came alone.”<br><br>  “Bring all thy host,” the hermit cried,<br>And Bharat, to his joy, complied.<br>Then to the chapel went the sire,<br>Where ever burnt the sacred fire,<br>And first, in order due, with sips<br>Of water purified his lips:<br>To Viśvakarmá, then he prayed,<br>His hospitable feast to aid:<br>“Let Viśvakarmá hear my call,<br>The God who forms and fashions all:<br>A mighty banquet I provide,<br>Be all my wants this day supplied.<br>Lord Indra at their head, the three<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Yáma, Varuṇa, and Kuvera.

abound,<br>Spring from the trees that bloom around.<br>Each sort of wine to woo the taste,<br>And meats of every kind be placed.”<br><br>  Thus spake the hermit self-restrained,<br>With proper tone by rules ordained,<br>On deepest meditation bent,<br>In holy might preëminent.<br>Then as with hands in reverence raised<br>Absorbed in thought he eastward gazed,<br>The deities he thus addressed<br>Came each in semblance manifest.<br>Delicious gales that cooled the frame<br>From Malaya and Dardar came,<br>That kissed those scented hills and threw<br>Auspicious fragrance where they blew.<br>Then falling fast in sweetest showers<br>Came from the sky immortal flowers,<br>And all the airy region round<br>With heavenly drums was made to sound.<br>Then breathed a soft celestial breeze,<br>Then danced the bright Apsarases,<br>The minstrels and the Gods advanced,<br>And warbling lutes the soul entranced.<br>The earth and sky that music filled,<br>And through each ear it softly thrilled,<br>As from the heavenly quills it fell<br>With time and tune attempered well.<br>Soon as the minstrels ceased to play<br>And airs celestial died away,<br>The troops of Bharat saw amazed<br>What Viśvakarmá’s art had raised.<br>On every side, five leagues around,<br>All smooth and level lay the ground,<br>With fresh green grass that charmed the sight<br>Like sapphires blent with lazulite.<br>There the Wood-apple hung its load,<br>The Mango and the Citron glowed,<br>The Bel and scented Jak were there,<br>And Apelá with fruitage fair.<br>There, brought from Northern Kuru, stood<br>Rich in delights, the glorious wood,<br>And many a stream was seen to glide<br>With flowering trees along its side.<br>There mansions rose with four wide halls,<br>And elephants and chargers’ stalls,<br>And many a house of royal state,<br>Triumphal arc and bannered gate.<br>With noble doorways, sought the sky,<br>Like a pale cloud, a palace high,<br>Which far and wide rare fragrance shed,<br>With wreaths of white engarlanded.<br>Square was its shape, its halls were wide,<br>With many a seat and couch supplied,<br>Drink of all kinds, and every meat<br>Such as celestial Gods might eat.<br>Then at the bidding of the seer<br>Kaikeyí’s strong-armed son drew near,<br>And passed within that fair abode<br>Which with the noblest jewels glowed.<br>Then, as Vaśishṭha led the way,<br>The councillors, in due array,<br>Followed delighted and amazed<br>And on the glorious structure gazed.<br>Then Bharat, Raghu’s son, drew near<br>The kingly throne, with prince and peer,<br>Whereby the chouri in the shade<br>Of the white canopy was laid.<br>Before the throne he humbly bent<br>And honoured Ráma, reverent,<br>Then in his hand the chouri bore,<br>And sat where sits a councillor.<br>His ministers and household priest<br>Sat by degrees from chief to least,<br>Then sat the captain of the host<br>And all the men he honoured most.<br>Then when the saint his order gave,<br>Each river with enchanted wave<br>Rolled milk and curds divinely sweet<br>Before the princely Bharat’s feet;<br>And dwellings fair on either side,<br>With gay white plaster beautified,<br>Their heavenly roofs were seen to lift,<br>The Bráhman Bharadvája’s gift.<br>Then straight by Lord Kuvera sent,<br>Gay with celestial ornament<br>Of bright attire and jewels’ shine,<br>Came twenty thousand nymphs divine:<br>The man on whom those beauties glanced<br>That moment felt his soul entranced.<br>With them from Nandan’s blissful shades<br>Came twenty thousand heavenly maids.<br>Tumburu, Nárad, Gopa came,<br>And Sutanu, like radiant flame,<br>The kings of the Gandharva throng,<br>And ravished Bharat with their song.<br>Then spoke the saint, and swift obeyed<br>Alambúshá, the fairest maid,<br>And Miśrakeśí bright to view,<br>Ramaṇá, Puṇḍríká too,<br>And danced to him with graceful ease<br>The dances of Apsarases.<br>All chaplets that by Gods are worn,<br>Or Chaitraratha’s graves adorn,<br>Bloomed by the saint’s command arrayed<br>On branches in Prayága’s shade.<br>When at the saint’s command the breeze<br>Made music with the Vilva trees,<br>To wave in rhythmic beat began<br>The boughs of each Myrobolan,<br>And holy fig-trees wore the look<br>Of dancers, as their leaflets shook.<br>The fair Tamála, palm, and pine,<br>With trees that tower and plants that twine,<br>The sweetly varying forms displayed<br>Of stately dame or bending maid.<br>Here men the foaming winecup quaffed,<br>Here drank of milk full many a draught,<br>And tasted meats of every kind,<br>Well dressed, whatever pleased their mind.<br>Then beauteous women, seven or eight,<br>Stood ready by each man to wait:<br>Beside the stream his limbs they stripped<br>And in the cooling water dipped.<br>And then the fair ones, sparkling eyed,<br>With soft hands rubbed his limbs and dried,<br>And sitting on the lovely bank<br>Held up the winecup as he drank.<br>Nor did the grooms forget to feed<br>Camel and mule and ox and steed,<br>For there were stores of roasted grain,<br>Of honey and of sugar-cane.<br>So fast the wild excitement spread<br>Among the warriors Bharat led,<br>That all the mighty army through<br>The groom no more his charger knew,<br>And he who drove might seek in vain<br>To tell his elephant again.<br>With every joy and rapture fired,<br>Entranced with all the heart desired,<br>The myriads of the host that night<br>Revelled delirious with delight.<br>Urged by the damsels at their side<br>In wild delight the warriors cried:<br>“Ne’er will we seek Ayodhyá, no,<br>Nor yet to Daṇḍak forest go:<br>Here will we stay: may happy fate<br>On Bharat and on Ráma wait.”<br>Thus cried the army gay and free<br>Exulting in their lawless glee,<br>Both infantry and those who rode<br>On elephants, or steeds bestrode,<br>Ten thousand voices shouting, “This<br>Is heaven indeed for perfect bliss.”<br>With garlands decked they idly strayed,<br>And danced and laughed and sang and played.<br>At length as every soldier eyed,<br>With food like Amrit satisfied,<br>Each dainty cate and tempting meat,<br>No longer had he care to eat.<br>Thus soldier, servant, dame, and slave<br>Received whate’er the wish might crave.<br>As each in new-wrought clothes arrayed<br>Enjoyed the feast before him laid.<br>Each man was seen in white attire<br>Unstained by spot or speck of mire:<br>None was athirst or hungry there,<br>And none had dust upon his hair.<br>On every side in woody dells<br>Was milky food in bubbling wells,<br>And there were all-supplying cows<br>And honey dropping from the boughs.<br>Nor wanted lakes of flower-made drink<br>With piles of meat upon the brink,<br>Boiled, stewed, and roasted, varied cheer,<br>Peachick and jungle-fowl and deer,<br>There was the flesh of kid and boar,<br>And dainty sauce in endless store,<br>With juice of flowers concocted well,<br>And soup that charmed the taste and smell,<br>And pounded fruits of bitter taste,<br>And many a bath was ready placed<br>Down by each river’s shelving side<br>There stood great basins well supplied,<br>And laid therein, of dazzling sheen,<br>White brushes for the teeth were seen,<br>And many a covered box wherein<br>Was sandal powdered for the skin.<br>And mirrors bright with constant care,<br>And piles of new attire were there,<br>And store of sandals and of shoes,<br>Thousands of pairs, for all to choose:<br>Eye-unguents, combs for hair and beard,<br>Umbrellas fair and bows appeared.<br>Lakes gleamed, that lent digestive aid,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The poet does not tell us what these lakes contained.

</span></span><br>And some for pleasant bathing made,<br>With waters fair, and smooth incline<br>For camels, horses, mules, and kine.<br>There saw they barley heaped on high<br>The countless cattle to supply:<br>The golden grain shone fair and bright<br>As sapphires or the lazulite.<br>To all the gathered host it seemed<br>As if that magic scene they dreamed,<br>And wonder, as they gazed, increased<br>At Bharadvája’s glorious feast.<br><br>  Thus in the hermit’s grove they spent<br>That night in joy and merriment,<br>Blest as the Gods who take their ease<br>Under the shade of Nandan’s trees.<br>Each minstrel bade the saint adieu,<br>And to his blissful mansion flew,<br>And every stream and heavenly dame<br>Returned as swiftly as she came.
