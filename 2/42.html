Kaikeyí, touch me not.<br>No loving wife, no friend to me,<br>I ne’er again would look on thee;<br>Ne’er from this day have aught to do<br>With thee and all thy retinue;<br>Thee whom no virtuous thoughts restrain,<br>Whose selfish heart seeks only gain.<br>The hand I laid in mine, O dame,<br>The steps we took around the flame,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">In the marriage service.
