                            When Lakshmaṇ, who had joined them there,<br>Had heard the converse of the pair,<br>His mien was changed, his eyes o’erflowed,<br>His breast no more could bear its load.<br>The son of Raghu, sore distressed,<br>His brother’s feet with fervour pressed,<br>While thus to Sítá he complained,<br>And him by lofty vows enchained:<br>“If thou wilt make the woods thy home,<br>Where elephant and roebuck roam,<br>I too this day will take my bow<br>And in the path before thee go.<br>Our way will lie through forest ground<br>Where countless birds and beasts are found,<br>I heed not homes of Gods on high,<br>I heed not life that cannot die,<br>Nor would I wish, with thee away,<br>O’er the three worlds to stretch my sway.”<br><br>  Thus Lakshmaṇ spake, with earnest prayer<br>His brother’s woodland life to share.<br>As Ráma still his prayer denied<br>With soothing words, again he cried:<br>“When leave at first thou didst accord,<br>Why dost thou stay me now, my lord?<br>Thou art my refuge: O, be kind,<br>Leave me not, dear my lord, behind.<br>Thou canst not, brother, if thou choose<br>That I still live, my wish refuse.”<br><br>  The glorious chief his speech renewed<br>To faithful Lakshmaṇ as he sued,<br>And on the eyes of Ráma gazed<br>Longing to lead, with hands upraised:<br>“Thou art a hero just and dear,<br>Whose steps to virtue’s path adhere,<br>Loved as my life till life shall end,<br>My faithful brother and my friend.<br>If to the woods thou take thy way<br>With Sítá and with me to-day,<br>Who for Kauśalyá will provide,<br>And guard the good Sumitrá’s side?<br>The lord of earth, of mighty power,<br>Who sends good things in plenteous shower,<br>As Indra pours the grateful rain,<br>A captive lies in passion’s chain.<br>The power imperial for her son<br>Has Aśvapati’s daughter<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Kaikeyí.
