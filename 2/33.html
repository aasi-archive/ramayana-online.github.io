                            Thus Sítá and the princes brave<br>Much wealth to all the Bráhmans gave.<br>Then to the monarch’s house the three<br>Went forth the aged king to see.<br>The princes from two servants took<br>Those heavenly arms of glorious look,<br>Adorned with garland and with band<br>By Sítá’s beautifying hand.<br>On each high house a mournful throng<br>Had gathered ere they passed along,<br>Who gazed in pure unselfish woe<br>From turret, roof, and portico.<br>So dense the crowd that blocked the ways,<br>The rest, unable there to gaze,<br>Were fain each terrace to ascend,<br>And thence their eyes on Ráma bend.<br>Then as the gathered multitude<br>On foot their well-loved Ráma viewed,<br>No royal shade to screen his head,<br>Such words, disturbed in grief, they said:<br>“O look, our hero, wont to ride<br>Leading a host in perfect pride—<br>Now Lakshmaṇ, sole of all his friends,<br>With Sítá on his steps attends.<br>Though he has known the sweets of power,<br>And poured his gifts in liberal shower,<br>From duty’s path he will not swerve,<br>But, still his father’s truth preserve.<br>And she whose form so soft and fair<br>Was veiled from spirits of the air,<br>Now walks unsheltered from the day,<br>Seen by the crowds who throng the way.<br>Ah, for that gently-nurtured form!<br>How will it fade with sun and storm!<br>How will the rain, the cold, the heat<br>Mar fragrant breast and tinted feet!<br>Surely some demon has possessed<br>His sire, and speaks within his breast,<br>Or how could one that is a king<br>Thus send his dear son wandering?<br>It were a deed unkindly done<br>To banish e’en a worthless son:<br>But what, when his pure life has gained<br>The hearts of all, by love enchained?<br>Six sovereign virtues join to grace<br>Ráma the foremost of his race:<br>Tender and kind and pure is he,<br>Docile, religious, passion-free.<br>Hence misery strikes not him alone:<br>In bitterest grief the people moan,<br>Like creatures of the stream, when dry<br>In the great heat the channels lie.<br>The world is mournful with the grief<br>That falls on its beloved chief,<br>As, when the root is hewn away,<br>Tree, fruit, and flower, and bud decay.<br>The soul of duty, bright to see,<br>He is the root of you and me;<br>And all of us, who share his grief,<br>His branches, blossom, fruit, and leaf.<br>Now like the faithful Lakshmaṇ, we<br>Will follow and be true as he;<br>Our wives and kinsmen call with speed,<br>And hasten where our lord shall lead.<br>Yes, we will leave each well-loved spot,<br>The field, the garden, and the cot,<br>And, sharers of his weal and woe,<br>Behind the pious Ráma go.<br>Our houses, empty of their stores,<br>With ruined courts and broken doors,<br>With all their treasures borne away.<br>And gear that made them bright and gay:<br>O’errun by rats, with dust o’erspread,<br>Shrines, whence the deities have fled,<br>Where not a hand the water pours,<br>Or sweeps the long-neglected floors,<br>No incense loads the evening air,<br>No Bráhmans chant the text and prayer,<br>No fire of sacrifice is bright,<br>No gift is known, no sacred rite;<br>With floors which broken vessels strew,<br>As if our woes had crushed them too—<br>Of these be stern Kaikeyí queen,<br>And rule o’er homes where we have been.<br>The wood where Ráma’s feet may roam<br>Shall be our city and our home,<br>And this fair city we forsake,<br>Our flight a wilderness shall make.<br>Each serpent from his hole shall hie,<br>The birds and beasts from mountain fly,<br>Lions and elephants in fear<br>Shall quit the woods when we come near,<br>Yield the broad wilds for us to range,<br>And take our city in exchange.<br>With Ráma will we hence, content<br>If, where he is, our days be spent.”<br><br>  Such were the varied words the crowd<br>Of all conditions spoke aloud.<br>And Ráma heard their speeches, yet<br>Changed not his purpose firmly set.<br>His father’s palace soon he neared,<br>That like Kailása’s hill appeared.<br>Like a wild elephant he strode<br>Right onward to the bright abode.<br>Within the palace court he stepped,<br>Where ordered bands their station kept,<br>And saw Sumantra standing near<br>With down-cast eye and gloomy cheer.
