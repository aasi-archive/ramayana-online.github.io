                            The dark incomparable chief<br>Whose eye was like a lotus leaf,<br>Cried to the mournful charioteer,<br>“Go tell my sire that I am here.”<br><br>  Sumantra, sad and all dismayed,<br>The chieftain’s order swift obeyed.<br>Within the palace doors he hied<br>And saw the king, who wept and sighed.<br>Like the great sun when wrapped in shade<br>Like fire by ashes overlaid,<br>Or like a pool with waters dried,<br>So lay the world’s great lord and pride,<br>A while the wise Sumantra gazed<br>On him whose senses woe has dazed,<br>Grieving for Ráma. Near he drew<br>With hands upraised in reverence due.<br>With blessing first his king he hailed;<br>Then with a voice that well-nigh failed,<br>In trembling accents soft and low<br>Addressed the monarch in his woe:<br>“The prince of men, thy Ráma, waits<br>Before thee at the palace gates.<br>His wealth to Bráhmans he has dealt,<br>And all who in his home have dwelt.<br>Admit thy son. His friends have heard<br>His kind farewell and parting word,<br>He longs to see thee first, and then<br>Will seek the wilds, O King of men.<br>He, with each princely virtue’s blaze,<br>Shines as the sun engirt by rays.”<br><br>  The truthful King who loved to keep<br>The law profound as Ocean’s deep,<br>And stainless as the dark blue sky,<br>Thus to Sumantra made reply:<br>“Go then, Sumantra, go and call<br>My wives and ladies one and all.<br>Drawn round me shall they fill the place<br>When I behold my Ráma’s face.”<br><br>  Quick to the inner rooms he sped,<br>And thus to all the women said,<br>“Come, at the summons of the king:<br>Come all, and make no tarrying.”<br><br>  Their husband’s word, by him conveyed,<br>Soon as they heard, the dames obeyed,<br>And following his guidance all<br>Came thronging to the regal hall.<br>In number half seven hundred, they,<br>All lovely dames, in long array,<br>With their bright eyes for weeping red,<br>To stand round Queen Kauśalyá, sped.<br>They gathered, and the monarch viewed<br>One moment all the multitude,<br>Then to Sumantra spoke and said:<br>“Now let my son be hither led.”<br><br>  Sumantra went. Then Ráma came,<br>And Lakshmaṇ, and the Maithil dame,<br>And, as he led them on, their guide<br>Straight to the monarch’s presence hied.<br>When yet far off the father saw<br>His son with raised palms toward him draw,<br>Girt by his ladies, sick with woes,<br>Swift from his royal seat he rose.<br>With all his strength the aged man<br>To meet his darling Ráma ran,<br>But trembling, wild with dark despair,<br>Fell on the ground and fainted there.<br>And Lakshmaṇ, wont in cars to ride,<br>And Ráma, threw them by the side<br>Of the poor miserable king,<br>Half lifeless with his sorrow’s sting.<br>Throughout the spacious hall up went<br>A thousand women’s wild lament:<br>“Ah Ráma!” thus they wailed and wept,<br>And anklets tinkled as they stepped<br>Around his body, weeping, threw<br>Their loving arms the brothers two,<br>And then, with Sítá’s gentle aid,<br>The king upon a couch was laid.<br>At length to earth’s imperial lord,<br>When life and knowledge were restored,<br>Though seas of woe went o’er his head,<br>With suppliant hand, thus Ráma said:<br>“Lord of us all, great King, thou art:<br>Bid me farewell before we part,<br>To Daṇḍak wood this day I go:<br>One blessing and one look bestow.<br>Let Lakshmaṇ my companion be,<br>And Sítá also follow me.<br>With truthful pleas I sought to bend<br>Their purpose; but no ear they lend.<br>Now cast this sorrow from thy heart,<br>And let us all, great King, depart.<br>As Brahmá sends his children, so<br>Let Lakshmaṇ, me, and Sítá go.”<br><br>  He stood unmoved, and watched intent<br>Until the king should grant consent.<br>Upon his son his eyes he cast,<br>And thus the monarch spake at last:<br>“O Ráma, by her arts enslaved,<br>I gave the boons Kaikeyí craved,<br>Unfit to reign, by her misled:<br>Be ruler in thy father’s stead.”<br><br>  Thus by the lord of men addressed,<br>Ráma, of virtue’s friends the best,<br>In lore of language duly learned,<br>His answer, reverent, thus returned:<br>“A thousand years, O King, remain<br>O’er this our city still to reign.<br>I in the woods my life will lead:<br>The lust of rule no more I heed.<br>Nine years and five I there will spend,<br>And when the portioned days shall end,<br>Will come, my vows and exile o’er,<br>And clasp thy feet, my King, once more.”<br><br>  A captive in the snare of truth,<br>Weeping, distressed with woe and ruth,<br>Thus spake the monarch, while the queen<br>Kaikeyí urged him on unseen:<br>“Go then, O Ráma, and begin<br>Thy course unvext by fear and sin:<br>Go, my beloved son, and earn<br>Success, and joy, and safe return.<br>So fast the bonds of duty bind.<br>O Raghu’s son, thy truthful mind,<br>That naught can turn thee back, or guide<br>Thy will so strongly fortified.<br>But O, a little longer stay,<br>Nor turn thy steps this night away,<br>That I one little day-—alas!<br>One only—-with my son may pass.<br>Me and thy mother do not slight,<br>But stay, my son, with me to-night;<br>With every dainty please thy taste,<br>And seek to-morrow morn the waste.<br>Hard is thy task, O Raghu’s son,<br>Dire is the toil thou wilt not shun,<br>Far to the lonely wood to flee,<br>And leave thy friends for love of me.<br>I swear it by my truth, believe,<br>For thee, my son, I deeply grieve,<br>Misguided by the traitress dame<br>With hidden guile like smouldering flame.<br>Now, by her wicked counsel stirred,<br>Thou fain wouldst keep my plighted word.<br>No marvel that my eldest born<br>Would hold me true when I have sworn.”<br><br>  Then Ráma having calmly heard<br>His wretched father speak each word,<br>With Lakshmaṇ standing by his side<br>Thus, humbly, to the King replied:<br>“If dainties now my taste regale,<br>To-morrow must those dainties fail.<br>This day departure I prefer<br>To all that wealth can minister.<br>O’er this fair land, no longer mine,<br>Which I, with all her realms, resign,<br>Her multitudes of men, her grain,<br>Her stores of wealth, let Bharat reign.<br>And let the promised boon which thou<br>Wast pleased to grant the queen ere now,<br>Be hers in full. Be true, O King,<br>Kind giver of each precious thing.<br>Thy spoken word I still will heed,<br>Obeying all thy lips decreed:<br>And fourteen years in woods will dwell<br>With those who live in glade and dell.<br>No hopes of power my heart can touch,<br>No selfish joys attract so much<br>As son of Raghu, to fulfil<br>With heart and soul my father’s will.<br>Dismiss, dismiss thy needless woe,<br>Nor let those drowning torrents flow:<br>The Lord of Rivers in his pride<br>Keeps to the banks that bar his tide.<br>Here in thy presence I declare;<br>By thy good deeds, thy truth, I swear;<br>Nor lordship, joy, nor lands I prize;<br>Life, heaven, all blessings I despise.<br>I wish to see thee still remain<br>Most true, O King, and free from stain.<br>It must not, Sire, it must not be:<br>I cannot rest one hour with thee.<br>Then bring this sorrow to an end,<br>For naught my settled will can bend.<br>I gave a pledge that binds me too,<br>And to that pledge I still am true.<br>Kaikeyí bade me speed away:<br>She prayed me, and I answered yea.<br>Pine not for me, and weep no more;<br>The wood for us has joy in store,<br>Filled with the wild deer’s peaceful herds<br>And voices of a thousand birds.<br>A father is the God of each,<br>Yea, e’en of Gods, so Scriptures teach:<br>And I will keep my sire’s decree,<br>For as a God I honour thee.<br>O best of men, the time is nigh,<br>The fourteen years will soon pass by<br>And to thine eyes thy son restore:<br>Be comforted, and weep no more.<br>Thou with thy firmness shouldst support<br>These weeping crowds who throng the court;<br>Then why, O chief of high renown,<br>So troubled, and thy soul cast down?”
