                            Then Ráma gazed, and scarcely knew<br>Bharat so worn and changed in hue.<br>He raised him, kissed him on the head,<br>Embraced him, and thus kindly said:<br>“Where was thy father, brother dear,<br>That thou art come to seek me here?<br>Unmeet, if he be living yet,<br>Thy feet within the wood to set.<br>I pray thee now the cause declare<br>Why thou hast left the kingdom there,<br>With matted locks and deerskin dress<br>To roam the distant wilderness.”<br><br>  Thus questioned by the prince, at length<br>Kaikeyí’s son regained his strength,<br>And hand to hand in reverence laid,<br>To Ráma thus his answer made:<br>“The great-armed monarch, O my lord,<br>Has dared to do a thing abhorred,<br>Left us, and grieving for his son,<br>A home among the Gods has won.<br>My mother Queen Kaikeyí gave<br>The order to the king her slave,<br>And at the bidding of the dame<br>He wrought the sin which mars his fame.<br>Athirst for sway, her hopes are crossed,<br>She mourns her son, her husband lost,<br>And through her impious crime will go<br>For punishment to hell below.<br>Now O my lord, forgive me all;<br>Be gracious to thy lowly thrall:<br>Anointed king, accept to-day<br>Like Indra’s self, the royal sway.<br>Be gracious, Prince, to lord and peer,<br>And widowed queens who seek thee here<br>Accept the kingdom thine by right,<br>And so thy faithful friends delight.<br>Let the broad land no longer be<br>All widowed and forlorn of thee:<br>Let the full moon of autumn reign<br>Triumphant o’er the night again.<br>These lords and I before thee bend:<br>O Ráma, to our prayer attend.<br>O do not thou this grace deny:<br>Thy brother, pupil, slave am I.<br>Look on this venerable ring,<br>Advisers of our sire the king,<br>From age to age so honoured: thou<br>Shouldst grant their supplication now.”<br><br>  As weeping thus the hero prayed,<br>His head at Ráma’s feet he laid.<br>Like a mad elephant he sighed:<br>And Ráma gazed and thus replied:<br>“How, brother, can a man of worth,<br>True to his vows, of noble birth—<br>A man like me, commit a sin<br>The lordship of the land to win?<br>No slightest shade of fault I see,<br>O tamer of thy foes, in thee.<br>But ne’er shouldst thou in childish thought<br>The queen thy mother blame in aught.<br>O brother wise and sinless, know<br>The sacred laws would have it so,<br>That from good wife and son require<br>Obedience to their lord and sire.<br>And we are all the king’s, for thus<br>The virtuous ever reckon us:<br>Yea brother, be it known to thee,<br>His wives, and sons, and pupils we.<br>His is the right, if he deem fit,<br>To bid me, throned as monarch, sit,<br>Or in a coat of bark expel,<br>And deerskin, in the wood to dwell.<br>And O remember, best of all<br>Who act as claims of duty call,<br>As to a virtuous sire is due,<br>Such honour claims a mother too.<br>So they whose lives have ever been<br>By duty led, the king and queen,<br>Said, “Ráma, seek the forest shade:”<br>And I (what could I else?) obeyed.<br>Thou must the royal power retain,<br>And o’er the famed Ayodhyá reign:<br>I dressed in bark my days will spend<br>Where Daṇḍak’s forest wilds extend.<br>So Daśaratha spoke, our king,<br>His share to each apportioning<br>Before his honoured servants’ eyes:<br>Then, heir of bliss, he sought the skies.<br>The righteous monarch’s honoured will,<br>Whom all revered, must guide thee still,<br>And thou must still enjoy the share<br>Assigned thee by our father’s care.<br>So I till twice seven years are spent<br>Will roam this wood in banishment,<br>Contented with the lot which he,<br>My high-souled sire, has given me.<br>The charge the monarch gave, endeared<br>To all mankind, by all revered,<br>  Peer of the Lord Supreme,<br>Far better, richer far in gain<br>Of every blessing than to reign<br>  O’er all the worlds I deem.”
