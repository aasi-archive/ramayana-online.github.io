                            The tenth day passed: the prince again<br>Was free from every legal stain.<br>He bade them on the twelfth the great<br>Remaining honour celebrate.<br>Much gold he gave, and gems, and food,<br>To all the Bráhman multitude,<br>And goats whose hair was white and fine,<br>And many a thousand head of kine:<br>Slaves, men and damsels, he bestowed,<br>And many a car and fair abode:<br>Such gifts he gave the Bráhman race<br>His father’s obsequies to grace.<br>Then when the morning’s earliest ray<br>Appeared upon the thirteenth day,<br>Again the hero wept and sighed<br>Distraught and sorrow-stupefied;<br>Drew, sobbing in his anguish, near,<br>The last remaining debt to clear,<br>And at the bottom of the pyre,<br>He thus bespake his royal sire:<br>“O father, hast thou left me so,<br>Deserted in my friendless woe,<br>When he to whom the charge was given<br>To keep me, to the wood is driven?<br>Her only son is forced away<br>Who was his helpless mother’s stay:<br>Ah, whither, father, art thou fled;<br>Leaving the queen uncomforted?”<br><br>  He looked upon the pile where lay<br>The bones half-burnt and ashes grey,<br>And uttering a piteous moan,<br>Gave way, by anguish overthrown.<br>Then as his tears began to well,<br>Prostrate to earth the hero fell;<br>So from its seat the staff they drag,<br>And cast to earth some glorious flag.<br>The ministers approached again<br>The prince whom rites had freed from stain;<br>So when Yayáti fell, each seer,<br>In pity for his fate, drew near.<br>Śatrughna saw him lying low<br>O’erwhelmed beneath the crush of woe,<br>And as upon the king he thought,<br>He fell upon the earth distraught.<br>When to his loving memory came<br>Those noble gifts, that kingly frame,<br>He sorrowed, by his woe distressed,<br>As one by frenzied rage possessed:<br>“Ah me, this surging sea of woe<br>Has drowned us with its overflow:<br>The source is Manthará, dire and dark,<br>Kaikeyí is the ravening shark:<br>And the great boons the monarch gave<br>Lend conquering might to every wave.<br>Ah, whither wilt thou go, and leave<br>Thy Bharat in his woe to grieve,<br>Whom ever ’twas thy greatest joy<br>To fondle as a tender boy?<br>Didst thou not give with thoughtful care<br>Our food, our drink, our robes to wear?<br>Whose love will now for us provide,<br>When thou, our king and sire, hast died?<br>At such a time bereft, forlorn,<br>Why is not earth in sunder torn,<br>Missing her monarch’s firm control,<br>His love of right, his lofty soul?<br>Ah me, for Ráma roams afar,<br>My sire is where the Blessed are;<br>How can I live deserted? I<br>Will pass into the fire and die.<br>Abandoned thus, I will not brook<br>Upon Ayodhyá’s town to look,<br>Once guarded by Ikshváku’s race:<br>The wood shall be my dwelling place.”<br><br>  Then when the princes’ mournful train<br>Heard the sad brothers thus complain,<br>And saw their misery, at the view<br>Their grief burst wilder out anew.<br>Faint with lamenting, sad and worn,<br>Each like a bull with broken horn,<br>The brothers in their wild despair<br>Lay rolling, mad with misery, there.<br>Then old Vaśishṭha good and true,<br>Their father’s priest, all lore who knew,<br>Raised weeping Bharat on his feet,<br>And thus bespake with counsel meet:<br>“Twelve days, my lord, have past away<br>Since flames consumed thy father’s clay:<br>Delay no more: as rules ordain,<br>Gather what bones may yet remain.<br>Three constant pairs are ever found<br>To hem all mortal creatures round:<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Birth and death, pleasure and pain, loss and gain.

</span></span><br>Then mourn not thus, O Prince, for none<br>Their close companionship may shun.”<br><br>  Sumantra bade Śatrughna rise,<br>And soothed his soul with counsel wise,<br>And skilled in truth, his hearer taught<br>How all things are and come to naught.<br>When rose each hero from the ground,<br>A lion lord of men, renowned,<br>He showed like Indra’s flag,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Erected upon a tree or high staff in honour of Indra.

</span></span> whereon<br>Fierce rains have dashed and suns have shone.<br>They wiped their red and weeping eyes,<br>And gently made their sad replies:<br>Then, urged to haste, the royal pair<br>Performed the rites that claimed their care.
