                            But when Kauśalyásaw that he<br>Resolved to keep his sire’s decree,<br>While tears and sobs her utterance broke,<br>Her very righteous speech she spoke:<br>“Can he, a stranger yet to pain,<br>Whose pleasant words all hearts enchain,<br>Son of the king and me the queen,<br>Live on the grain his hands may glean;<br>Can he, whose slaves and menials eat<br>The finest cakes of sifted wheat—<br>Can Ráma in the forest live<br>On roots and fruit which woodlands give;<br>Who will believe, who will not fear<br>When the sad story smites his ear,<br>That one so dear, so noble held,<br>Is by the king his sire expelled?<br>Now surely none may Fate resist,<br>Which orders all as it may list,<br>If, Ráma, in thy strength and grace,<br>The woods become thy dwelling-place.<br>A childless mother long I grieved,<br>And many a sigh for offspring heaved,<br>With wistful longing weak and worn<br>Till thou at last, my son, wast born.<br>Fanned by the storm of that desire<br>Deep in my soul I felt the fire,<br>Whose offerings flowed from weeping eyes,<br>With fuel fed of groans and sighs,<br>While round the flame the smoke grew hot<br>Of tears because thou camest not.<br>Now reft of thee, too fiery fierce<br>The flame of woe my heart will pierce,<br>As, when the days of spring return,<br>The sun’s hot beams the forest burn.<br>The mother cow still follows near<br>The wanderings of her youngling dear.<br>So close to thine my feet shall be,<br>Where’er thou goest following thee.”<br><br>  Ráma, the noblest lord of men,<br>Heard his fond mother’s speech, and then<br>In soothing words like these replied<br>To the sad queen who wept and sighed:<br>“Nay, by Kaikeyí’s art beguiled,<br>When I am banished to the wild,<br>If thou, my mother, also fly,<br>The aged king will surely die.<br>When wedded dames their lords forsake,<br>Long for the crime their souls shall ache.<br>Thou must not e’en in thought within<br>Thy bosom frame so dire a sin.<br>Long as Kakutstha’s son, who reigns<br>Lord of the earth, in life remains,<br>Thou must with love his will obey:<br>This duty claims, supreme for aye.<br>Yes, mother, thou and I must be<br>Submissive to my sire’s decree,<br>King, husband, sire is he confessed,<br>The lord of all, the worthiest.<br>I in the wilds my days will spend<br>Till twice seven years have reached an end,<br>Then with great joy will come again,<br>And faithful to thy hests remain.”<br><br>  Kauśalyá by her son addressed,<br>With love and passion sore distressed,<br>Afflicted, with her eyes bedewed,<br>To Ráma thus her speech renewed:<br>  “Nay, Ráma, but my heart will break<br>If with these queens my home I make.<br>Lead me too with thee; let me go<br>And wander like a woodland roe.”<br>  Then, while no tear the hero shed,<br>Thus to the weeping queen he said:<br>“Mother, while lives the husband, he<br>Is woman’s lord and deity.<br>O dearest lady, thou and I<br>Our lord and king must ne’er deny;<br>The lord of earth himself have we<br>Our guardian wise and friend to be.<br>And Bharat, true to duty’s call,<br>Whose sweet words take the hearts of all,<br>Will serve thee well, and ne’er forget<br>The virtuous path before him set.<br>Be this, I pray, thine earnest care,<br>That the old king my father ne’er,<br>When I have parted hence, may know,<br>Grieved for his son, a pang of woe.<br>Let not this grief his soul distress,<br>To kill him with the bitterness.<br>With duteous care, in every thing,<br>Love, comfort, cheer the aged king.<br>Though, best of womankind, a spouse<br>Keeps firmly all her fasts and vows,<br>Nor yet her husband’s will obeys,<br>She treads in sin’s forbidden ways.<br>She to her husband’s will who bends,<br>Goes to high bliss that never ends,<br>Yea, though the Gods have found in her<br>No reverential worshipper.<br>Bent on his weal, a woman still<br>Must seek to do her husband’s will:<br>For Scripture, custom, law uphold<br>This duty Heaven revealed of old.<br>Honour true Bráhmans for my sake,<br>And constant offerings duly make,<br>With fire-oblations and with flowers,<br>To all the host of heavenly powers.<br>Look to the coming time, and yearn<br>For the glad hour of my return.<br>And still thy duteous course pursue,<br>Abstemious, humble, kind, and true.<br>The highest bliss shalt thou obtain<br>When I from exile come again,<br>If, best of those who keep the right,<br>The king my sire still see the light.”<br><br>  The queen, by Ráma thus addressed,<br>Still with a mother’s grief oppressed,<br>While her long eyes with tears were dim,<br>Began once more and answered him:<br>“Not by my pleading may be stayed<br>The firm resolve thy soul has made.<br>My hero, thou wilt go; and none<br>The stern commands of Fate may shun.<br>Go forth, dear child whom naught can bend,<br>And may all bliss thy steps attend.<br>Thou wilt return, and that dear day<br>Will chase mine every grief away.<br>Thou wilt return, thy duty done,<br>Thy vows discharged, high glory won;<br>From filial debt wilt thou be free,<br>And sweetest joy will come on me.<br>My son, the will of mighty Fate<br>At every time must dominate,<br>If now it drives thee hence to stray<br>Heedless of me who bid thee stay.<br>Go, strong of arm, go forth, my boy,<br>Go forth, again to come with joy,<br>And thine expectant mother cheer<br>With those sweet tones she loves to hear.<br>O that the blessed hour were nigh<br>When thou shalt glad this anxious eye,<br>With matted hair and hermit dress<br>returning from the wilderness.”<br>  Kauśalyá’s conscious soul approved,<br>    As her proud glance she bent<br>  On Ráma constant and unmoved,<br>    Resolved on banishment.<br>  Such words, with happy omens fraught<br>    To her dear son she said,<br>  Invoking with each eager thought<br>    A blessing on his head.
