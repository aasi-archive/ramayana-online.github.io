Yamuná, and passing o’er,<br>Rested his army on the shore:<br>He gave his horses food and rest,<br>Bathed reeking limb and drooping crest.<br>They drank their fill and bathed them there,<br>And water for their journey bare.<br>Thence through a mighty wood he sped<br>All wild and uninhabited,<br>As in fair chariot through the skies,<br>Most fair in shape a Storm-God flies.<br>At Anśudhána Gangá, hard<br>To cross, his onward journey barred,<br>So turning quickly thence he came<br>To Prágvaṭ’s city dear to fame.<br>There having gained the farther side<br>To Kuṭikoshṭiká he hied:<br>The stream he crossed, and onward then<br>To Dharmavardhan brought his men.<br>Thence, leaving Toraṇ on the north,<br>To Jambuprastha journeyed forth.<br>Then onward to a pleasant grove<br>By fair Varútha’s town he drove,<br>And when a while he there had stayed,<br>Went eastward from the friendly shade.<br>Eastward of Ujjiháná where<br>The Priyak trees are tall and fair,<br>He passed, and rested there each steed<br>Exhausted with the journey’s speed.<br>There orders to his men addressed,<br>With quickened pace he onward pressed,<br>A while at Sarvatírtha spent,<br>Then o’er Uttániká he went.<br>O’er many a stream beside he sped<br>With coursers on the mountains bred,<br>And passing Hastiprishṭhak, took<br>The road o’er Kuṭiká’s fair brook.<br>Then, at Lohitya’s village, he<br>Crossed o’er the swift Kapívatí,<br>Then passed, where Ekaśála stands,<br>The Stháṇumatí’s flood and sands,<br>And Gomatí of fair renown<br>By Vinata’s delightful town.<br>When to Kalinga near he drew,<br>A wood of Sal trees charmed the view;<br>That passed, the sun began to rise,<br>And Bharat saw with happy eyes,<br>Ayodhyá’s city, built and planned<br>By ancient Manu’s royal hand.<br>Seven nights upon the road had passed,<br>And when he saw the town at last<br>Before him in her beauty spread,<br>Thus Bharat to the driver said:<br>“This glorious city from afar,<br>Wherein pure groves and gardens are,<br>Seems to my eager eyes to-day<br>A lifeless pile of yellow clay.<br>Through all her streets where erst a throng<br>Of men and women streamed along,<br>Uprose the multitudinous roar:<br>To-day I hear that sound no more.<br>No longer do mine eyes behold<br>The leading people, as of old,<br>On elephants, cars, horses, go<br>Abroad and homeward, to and fro.<br>The brilliant gardens, where we heard<br>The wild note of each rapturous bird,<br>Where men and women loved to meet,<br>In pleasant shades, for pastime sweet,—<br>These to my eyes this day appear<br>Joyless, and desolate, and drear:<br>Each tree that graced the garden grieves,<br>And every path is spread with leaves.<br>The merry cry of bird and beast,<br>That spake aloud their joy, has ceased:<br>Still is the long melodious note<br>That charmed us from each warbling throat.<br>Why blows the blessed air no more,<br>The incense-breathing air that bore<br>Its sweet incomparable scent<br>Of sandal and of aloe blent?<br>Why are the drum and tabour mute?<br>Why is the music of the lute<br>That woke responsive to the quill,<br>Loved by the happy, hushed and still?<br>My boding spirit gathers hence<br>Dire sins of awful consequence,<br>And omens, crowding on my sight,<br>Weigh down my soul with wild affright.<br>Scarce shall I find my friends who dwell<br>Here in Ayodhyá safe and well:<br>For surely not without a cause<br>This crushing dread my soul o’erawes.”<br><br>  Heart sick, dejected, every sense<br>Confused by terror’s influence,<br>On to the town he quickly swept<br>Which King Ikshváku’s children kept.<br>He passed through Vaijayanta’s gate,<br>With weary steeds, disconsolate,<br>And all who near their station held,<br>His escort, crying Victory, swelled,<br>With heart distracted still he bowed<br>Farewell to all the following crowd,<br>Turned to the driver and began<br>To question thus the weary man:<br>“Why was I brought, O free from blame,<br>So fast, unknown for what I came?<br>Yet fear of ill my heart appals,<br>And all my wonted courage falls.<br>For I have heard in days gone by<br>The changes seen when monarchs die;<br>And all those signs, O charioteer,<br>I see to-day surround me here:<br>Each kinsman’s house looks dark and grim,<br>No hand delights to keep it trim:<br>The beauty vanished, and the pride,<br>The doors, unkept, stand open wide.<br>No morning rites are offered there,<br>No grateful incense loads the air,<br>And all therein, with brows o’ercast,<br>Sit joyless on the ground and fast.<br>Their lovely chaplets dry and dead,<br>Their courts unswept, with dust o’erspread,<br>The temples of the Gods to-day<br>No more look beautiful and gay.<br>Neglected stands each holy shrine,<br>Each image of a Lord divine.<br>No shop where flowery wreaths are sold<br>Is bright and busy as of old.<br>The women and the men I mark<br>Absorbed in fancies dull and dark,<br>Their gloomy eyes with tears bedewed,<br>A poor afflicted multitude.”<br><br>  His mind oppressed with woe and dread,<br>Thus Bharat to his driver said,<br>Viewed the dire signs Ayodhyá showed,<br>And onward to the palace rode.
