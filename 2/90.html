                            The prince of men a league away<br>Saw where the hermit’s dwelling lay,<br>Then with his lords his path pursued,<br>And left his warrior multitude.<br>On foot, as duty taught his mind,<br>He left his warlike gear behind;<br>Two robes of linen cloth he wore,<br>And bade Vaśishṭha walk before.<br>Then Bharat from his lords withdrew<br>When Bharadvája came in view,<br>And toward the holy hermit went<br>Behind Vaśishṭha, reverent.<br>When Bharadvája, saint austere,<br>Saw good Vaśishṭha drawing near,<br>He cried, upspringing from his seat,<br>“The grace-gift bring, my friend to greet.”<br>When Saint Vaśishṭha near him drew,<br>And Bharat paid the reverence due,<br>The glorious hermit was aware<br>That Daśaratha’s son was there.<br>The grace-gift, water for their feet<br>He gave, and offered fruit to eat;<br>Then, duty-skilled, with friendly speech<br>In seemly order questioned each:<br>“How fares it in Ayodhyá now<br>With treasury and army? how<br>With kith and kin and friends most dear,<br>With councillor, and prince, and peer?”<br>But, for he knew the king was dead,<br>Of Daśaratha naught he said.<br>Vaśishṭha and the prince in turn<br>Would of the hermit’s welfare learn:<br>Of holy fires they fain would hear,<br>Of pupils, trees, and birds, and deer.<br>The glorious saint his answer made<br>That all was well in holy shade:<br>Then love of Ráma moved his breast,<br>And thus he questioned of his guest:<br>“Why art thou here, O Prince, whose band<br>With kingly sway protects the land?<br>Declare the cause, explain the whole,<br>For yet some doubt disturbs my soul.<br>He whom Kauśalyá bare, whose might<br>The foemen slays, his line’s delight,<br>He who with wife and brother sent<br>Afar now roam in banishment,<br>Famed prince, to whom his father spake<br>This order for a woman’s sake:<br>“Away! and in the forest spend<br>Thy life till fourteen years shall end”—<br>Has thou the wish to harm him, bent<br>On sin against the innocent?<br>Wouldst thou thine elder’s realm enjoy<br>Without a thorn that can annoy?”<br><br>  With sobbing voice and tearful eye<br>Thus Bharat sadly made reply:<br>“Ah lost am I, if thou, O Saint,<br>Canst thus in thought my heart attaint:<br>No warning charge from thee I need;<br>Ne’er could such crime from me proceed.<br>The words my guilty mother spake<br>When fondly jealous for my sake—<br>Think not that I, to triumph moved,<br>Those words approve or e’er approved.<br>O Hermit, I have sought this place<br>To win the lordly hero’s grace,<br>To throw me at my brother’s feet<br>And lead him to his royal seat.<br>To this, my journey’s aim and end,<br>Thou shouldst, O Saint, thy favour lend:<br>Where is the lord of earth? do thou,<br>Most holy, say, where roams he now?”<br><br>  Then, by the saint Vaśishṭha pressed,<br>    And all the gathered priests beside,<br>  To Bharat’s dutiful request<br>    The hermit graciously replied:<br>“Worthy of thee, O Prince, this deed,<br>True son of Raghu’s ancient seed.<br>I know thee reverent, well-controlled,<br>The glory of the good of old.<br>I grant thy prayer: in this pursuit<br>I know thy heart is resolute.<br>’Tis for thy sake those words I said<br>That wider still thy fame may spread.<br>I know where Ráma, duty-tried,<br>His brother, and his wife abide.<br>Where Chitrakúṭa’s heights arise<br>Thy brother Ráma’s dwelling lies.<br>Go thither with the morning’s light,<br>And stay with all thy lords tonight:<br>For I would show thee honour high,<br>And do not thou my wish deny.”
