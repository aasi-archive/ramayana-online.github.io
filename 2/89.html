                            That night the son of Raghu lay<br>On Gangá’s bank till break of day:<br>Then with the earliest light he woke<br>And thus to brave Śatrughna spoke.<br>“Rise up, Śatrughna, from thy bed:<br>Why sleepest thou the night is fled.<br>See how the sun who chases night<br>Wakes every lotus with his light.<br>Arise, arise, and first of all<br>The lord of Śringavera call,<br>For he his friendly aid will lend<br>Our army o’er the flood to send.”<br><br>  Thus urged, Śatrughna answered: “I,<br>Remembering Ráma, sleepless lie.”<br>As thus the brothers, each to each,<br>The lion-mettled, ended speech,<br>Came Guha, the Nishádas’ king,<br>And spoke with kindly questioning:<br>“Hast thou in comfort passed,” he cried,<br>“The night upon the river side?<br>With thee how fares it? and are these,<br>Thy soldiers, healthy and at ease?”<br>Thus the Nishádas’ lord inquired<br>In gentle words which love inspired,<br>And Bharat, Ráma’s faithful slave,<br>Thus to the king his answer gave:<br>“The night has sweetly passed, and we<br>Are highly honoured, King, by thee.<br>Now let thy servants boats prepare,<br>Our army o’er the stream to bear.”<br><br>  The speech of Bharat Guha heard,<br>And swift to do his bidding stirred.<br>Within the town the monarch sped<br>And to his ready kinsmen said:<br>“Awake, each kinsman, rise, each friend!<br>May every joy your lives attend.<br>Gather each boat upon the shore<br>And ferry all the army o’er.”<br>Thus Guha spoke: nor they delayed,<br>But, rising quick, their lord obeyed,<br>And soon, from every side secured,<br>Five hundred boats were ready moored.<br>Some reared aloft the mystic sign,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The<em>&nbsp;svastika</em>, a little cross with a transverse line at each
