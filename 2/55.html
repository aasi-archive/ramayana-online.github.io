                            The princely tamers of their foes<br>Thus passed the night in calm repose,<br>Then to the hermit having bent<br>With reverence, on their way they went.<br>High favour Bharadvája showed,<br>And blessed them ready for the road.<br>With such fond looks as fathers throw<br>On their own sons, before they go.<br>Then spake the saint with glory bright<br>To Ráma peerless in his might:<br>“First, lords of men, direct your feet<br>Where Yamuná and Gangá meet;<br>Then to the swift Kálindí<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Another name of the Jumna, daughter of the Sun.

</span></span> go,<br>Whose westward waves to Gangá flow.<br>When thou shalt see her lovely shore<br>Worn by their feet who hasten o’er,<br>Then, Raghu’s son, a raft prepare,<br>And cross the Sun born river there.<br>Upon her farther bank a tree,<br>Near to the landing wilt thou see.<br>The blessed source of varied gifts,<br>There her green boughs that Fig-tree lifts:<br>A tree where countless birds abide,<br>By Śyáma’s name known far and wide.<br>Sítá, revere that holy shade:<br>There be thy prayers for blessing prayed.<br>Thence for a league your way pursue,<br>And a dark wood shall meet your view,<br>Where tall bamboos their foliage show,<br>The Gum-tree and the Jujube grow.<br>To Chitrakúṭa have I oft<br>Trodden that path so smooth and soft,<br>Where burning woods no traveller scare,<br>But all is pleasant, green, and fair.”<br><br>  When thus the guests their road had learned,<br>Back to his cot the hermit turned,<br>And Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, Sítá paid<br>Their reverent thanks for courteous aid.<br>Thus Ráma spake to Lakshmaṇ, when<br>The saint had left the lords of men:<br>“Great store of bliss in sooth is ours<br>On whom his love the hermit showers.”<br>As each to other wisely talked,<br>The lion lords together walked<br>On to Kálindí’s woody shore;<br>And gentle Sítá went before.<br>They reached that flood, whose waters flee<br>With rapid current to the sea;<br>Their minds a while to thought they gave<br>And counselled how to cross the wave.<br>At length, with logs together laid,<br>A mighty raft the brothers made.<br>Then dry bamboos across were tied,<br>And grass was spread from side to side.<br>And the great hero Lakshmaṇ brought<br>Cane and Rose-Apple boughs and wrought,<br>Trimming the branches smooth and neat,<br>For Sítá’s use a pleasant seat.<br>And Ráma placed thereon his dame<br>Touched with a momentary shame,<br>Resembling in her glorious mien<br>All-thought-surpassing Fortune’s Queen.<br>Then Ráma hastened to dispose,<br>Each in its place, the skins and bows,<br>And by the fair Videhan laid<br>The coats, the ornaments, and spade.<br>When Sítá thus was set on board,<br>And all their gear was duly stored,<br>The heroes each with vigorous hand,<br>Pushed off the raft and left the land.<br>When half its way the raft had made,<br>Thus Sítá to Kálindí prayed:<br>“Goddess, whose flood I traverse now,<br>Grant that my lord may keep his vow.<br>For thee shall bleed a thousand kine,<br>A hundred jars shall pour their wine,<br>When Ráma sees that town again<br>Where old Ikshváku’s children reign.”<br><br>  Thus to Kálindí’s stream she sued<br>And prayed in suppliant attitude.<br>Then to the river’s bank the dame,<br>Fervent in supplication, came.<br>They left the raft that brought them o’er,<br>And the thick wood that clothed the shore,<br>And to the Fig-tree Śyáma made<br>Their way, so cool with verdant shade.<br>Then Sítá viewed that best of trees,<br>And reverent spake in words like these:<br>“Hail, hail, O mighty tree! Allow<br>My husband to complete his vow;<br>Let us returning, I entreat,<br>Kauśalyá and Sumitrá meet.”<br>Then with her hands together placed<br>Around the tree she duly paced.<br>When Ráma saw his blameless spouse<br>A suppliant under holy boughs,<br>The gentle darling of his heart,<br>He thus to Lakshmaṇ spake apart:<br>“Brother, by thee our way be led;<br>Let Sítá close behind thee tread:<br>I, best of men, will grasp my bow,<br>And hindmost of the three will go.<br>What fruits soe’er her fancy take,<br>Or flowers half hidden in the brake,<br>For Janak’s child forget not thou<br>To gather from the brake or bough.”<br><br>  Thus on they fared. The tender dame<br>Asked Ráma, as they walked, the name<br>Of every shrub that blossoms bore,<br>Creeper, and tree unseen before:<br>And Lakshmaṇ fetched, at Sítá’s prayer,<br>Boughs of each tree with clusters fair.<br>Then Janak’s daughter joyed to see<br>The sand-discoloured river flee,<br>Where the glad cry of many a bird,<br>The sáras and the swan, was heard.<br>A league the brothers travelled through<br>The forest noble game they slew:<br>Beneath the trees their meal they dressed<br>And sat them down to eat and rest.<br>A while in that delightful shade<br>Where elephants unnumbered strayed,<br>Where peacocks screamed and monkeys played,<br>They wandered with delight.<br>Then by the river’s side they found<br>A pleasant spot of level ground,<br>Where all was smooth and fair around,<br>  Their lodging for the night.
