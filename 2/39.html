                            Scarce had the sire, with each dear queen,<br>Heard Ráma’s pleading voice, and seen<br>His darling in his hermit dress<br>Ere failed his senses for distress.<br>Convulsed with woe, his soul that shook,<br>On Raghu’s son he could not look;<br>Or if he looked with failing eye<br>He could not to the chief reply.<br>By pangs of bitter grief assailed,<br>The long-armed monarch wept and wailed,<br>Half dead a while and sore distraught,<br>While Ráma filled his every thought.<br>“This hand of mine in days ere now<br>Has reft her young from many a cow,<br>Or living things has idly slain:<br>Hence comes, I ween, this hour of pain.<br>Not till the hour is come to die<br>Can from its shell the spirit fly.<br>Death comes not, and Kaikeyí still<br>Torments the wretch she cannot kill,<br>Who sees his son before him quit<br>The fine soft robes his rank that fit,<br>And, glorious as the burning fire,<br>In hermit garb his limbs attire.<br>Now all the people grieve and groan<br>Through Queen Kaikeyí’s deed alone,<br>Who, having dared this deed of sin,<br>Strives for herself the gain to win.”<br><br>  He spoke. With tears his eyes grew dim,<br>His senses all deserted him.<br>He cried, O Ráma, once, then weak<br>And fainting could no further speak.<br>Unconscious there he lay: at length<br>Regathering his sense and strength,<br>While his full eyes their torrents shed,<br>To wise Sumantra thus he said:<br>“Yoke the light car, and hither lead<br>Fleet coursers of the noblest breed,<br>And drive this heir of lofty fate<br>Beyond the limit of the state.<br>This seems the fruit that virtues bear,<br>The meed of worth which texts declare—<br>The sending of the brave and good<br>By sire and mother to the wood.’”<br><br>  He heard the monarch, and obeyed,<br>With ready feet that ne’er delayed,<br>And brought before the palace gate<br>The horses and the car of state.<br>Then to the monarch’s son he sped,<br>And raising hands of reverence said<br>That the light car which gold made fair,<br>With best of steeds, was standing there.<br>King Daśaratha called in haste<br>The lord o’er all his treasures placed.<br>And spoke, well skilled in place and time,<br>His will to him devoid of crime:<br>“Count all the years she has to live<br>Afar in forest wilds, and give<br>To Sítá robes and gems of price<br>As for the time may well suffice.”<br>Quick to the treasure-room he went,<br>Charged by that king most excellent,<br>Brought the rich stores, and gave them all<br>To Sítá in the monarch’s hall.<br>The Maithil dame of high descent<br>Received each robe and ornament,<br>And tricked those limbs, whose lines foretold<br>High destiny, with gems and gold.<br>So well adorned, so fair to view,<br>A glory through the hall she threw:<br>So, when the Lord of Light upsprings,<br>His radiance o’er the sky he flings.<br>Then Queen Kauśalyá spake at last,<br>With loving arms about her cast,<br>Pressed lingering kisses on her head,<br>And to the high-souled lady said:<br>“Ah, in this faithless world below<br>When dark misfortune comes and woe,<br>Wives, loved and cherished every day,<br>Neglect their lords and disobey.<br>Yes, woman’s nature still is this:—<br>After long days of calm and bliss<br>When some light grief her spirit tries,<br>She changes all her love, or flies.<br>Young wives are thankless, false in soul,<br>With roving hearts that spurn control.<br>Brooding on sin and quickly changed,<br>In one short hour their love estranged.<br>Not glorious deed or lineage fair,<br>Not knowledge, gift, or tender care<br>In chains of lasting love can bind<br>A woman’s light inconstant mind.<br>But those good dames who still maintain<br>What right, truth, Scripture, rule ordain—<br>No holy thing in their pure eyes<br>With one beloved husband vies.<br>Nor let thy lord my son, condemned<br>To exile, be by thee contemned,<br>For be he poor or wealthy, he<br>Is as a God, dear child, to thee.”<br><br>  When Sítá heard Kauśalyá’s speech<br>Her duty and her gain to teach,<br>She joined her palms with reverent grace<br>And gave her answer face to face:<br>“All will I do, forgetting naught,<br>Which thou, O honoured Queen, hast taught.<br>I know, have heard, and deep have stored<br>The rules of duty to my lord.<br>Not me, good Queen, shouldst thou include<br>Among the faithless multitude.<br>Its own sweet light the moon shall leave<br>Ere I to duty cease to cleave.<br>The stringless lute gives forth no strain,<br>The wheelless car is urged in vain;<br>No joy a lordless dame, although<br>Blest with a hundred sons, can know.<br>From father, brother, and from son<br>A measured share of joy is won:<br>Who would not honour, love, and bless<br>Her lord, whose gifts are measureless?<br>Thus trained to think, I hold in awe<br>Scripture’s command and duty’s law.<br>Him can I hold in slight esteem?<br>Her lord is woman’s God, I deem.”<br>Kauśalyá heard the lady’s speech,<br>Nor failed those words her heart to reach.<br>Then, pure in mind, she gave to flow<br>The tear that sprang of joy and woe.<br>Then duteous Ráma forward came<br>And stood before the honoured dame,<br>And joining reverent hands addressed<br>The queen in rank above the rest:<br>“O mother, from these tears refrain;<br>Look on my sire and still thy pain.<br>To thee my days afar shall fly<br>As if sweet slumber closed thine eye,<br>And fourteen years of exile seem<br>To thee, dear mother, like a dream.<br>On me returning safe and well,<br>Girt by my friends, thine eyes shall dwell.”<br><br>  Thus for their deep affection’s sake<br>The hero to his mother spake,<br>Then to the half seven hundred too,<br>Wives of his sire, paid reverence due.<br>Thus Daśaratha’s son addressed<br>That crowd of matrons sore distressed:<br>“If from these lips, while here I dwelt,<br>One heedless taunt you e’er have felt,<br>Forgive me, pray. And now adieu,<br>I bid good-bye to all of you.”<br>Then straight, like curlews’ cries, upwent<br>The voices of their wild lament,<br>While, as he bade farewell, the crowd<br>Of royal women wept aloud,<br>And through the ample hall’s extent.<br>Where erst the sound of tabour, blent<br>With drum and shrill-toned instrument,<br>  In joyous concert rose,<br>Now rang the sound of wailing high,<br>The lamentation and the cry,<br>The shriek, the choking sob, the sigh<br>  That told the ladies’ woes.
