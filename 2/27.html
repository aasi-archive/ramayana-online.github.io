                            His sweetly-speaking bride, who best<br>Deserved her lord, he thus addressed.<br>Then tender love bade passion wake,<br>And thus the fair Videhan spake:<br>“What words are these that thou hast said?<br>Contempt of me the thought has bred.<br>O best of heroes, I dismiss<br>With bitter scorn a speech like this:<br>Unworthy of a warrior’s fame<br>It taints a monarch’s son with shame,<br>Ne’er to be heard from those who know<br>The science of the sword and bow.<br>My lord, the mother, sire, and son<br>Receive their lots by merit won;<br>The brother and the daughter find<br>The portions to their deeds assigned.<br>The wife alone, whate’er await,<br>Must share on earth her husband’s fate.<br>So now the king’s command which sends<br>Thee to the wild, to me extends.<br>The wife can find no refuge, none,<br>In father, mother, self, or son:<br>Both here, and when they vanish hence,<br>Her husband is her sole defence.<br>If, Raghu’s son, thy steps are led<br>Where Daṇḍak’s pathless wilds are spread,<br>My foot before thine own shall pass<br>Through tangled thorn and matted grass.<br>Dismiss thine anger and thy doubt:<br>Like refuse water cast them out,<br>And lead me, O my hero, hence—<br>I know not sin—with confidence.<br>Whate’er his lot, ’tis far more sweet<br>To follow still a husband’s feet<br>Than in rich palaces to lie,<br>Or roam at pleasure through the sky.<br>My mother and my sire have taught<br>What duty bids, and trained each thought,<br>Nor have I now mine ear to turn<br>The duties of a wife to learn.<br>I’ll seek with thee the woodland dell<br>And pathless wild where no men dwell,<br>Where tribes of silvan creatures roam,<br>And many a tiger makes his home.<br>My life shall pass as pleasant there<br>As in my father’s palace fair.<br>The worlds shall wake no care in me;<br>My only care be truth to thee.<br>There while thy wish I still obey,<br>True to my vows with thee I’ll stray,<br>And there shall blissful hours be spent<br>In woods with honey redolent.<br>In forest shades thy mighty arm<br>Would keep a stranger’s life from harm,<br>And how shall Sítá think of fear<br>When thou, O glorious lord, art near?<br>Heir of high bliss, my choice is made,<br>Nor can I from my will be stayed.<br>Doubt not; the earth will yield me roots,<br>These will I eat, and woodland fruits;<br>And as with thee I wander there<br>I will not bring thee grief or care.<br>I long, when thou, wise lord, art nigh,<br>All fearless, with delighted eye<br>To gaze upon the rocky hill,<br>The lake, the fountain, and the rill;<br>To sport with thee, my limbs to cool,<br>In some pure lily-covered pool,<br>While the white swan’s and mallard’s wings<br>Are plashing in the water-springs.<br>So would a thousand seasons flee<br>Like one sweet day, if spent with thee.<br>Without my lord I would not prize<br>A home with Gods above the skies:<br>Without my lord, my life to bless,<br>Where could be heaven or happiness?<br>  Forbid me not: with thee I go<br>    The tangled wood to tread.<br>  There will I live with thee, as though<br>    This roof were o’er my head.<br>  My will for thine shall be resigned;<br>    Thy feet my steps shall guide.<br>  Thou, only thou, art in my mind:<br>    I heed not all beside.<br>  Thy heart shall ne’er by me be grieved;<br>    Do not my prayer deny:<br>  Take me, dear lord; of thee bereaved<br>    Thy Sítá swears to die.”<br>  These words the duteous lady spake,<br>    Nor would he yet consent<br>  His faithful wife with him to take<br>    To share his banishment.<br>  He soothed her with his gentle speech;<br>    To change her will he strove;<br>  And much he said the woes to teach<br>    Of those in wilds who rove.
