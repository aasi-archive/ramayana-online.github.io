                            As fury lit Kaikeyí’s eyes<br>She spoke with long and burning sighs:<br>“This day my son enthroned shall see,<br>And Ráma to the woods shall flee.<br>But tell me, damsel, if thou can,<br>A certain way, a skilful plan<br>That Bharat may the empire gain,<br>And Ráma’s hopes be nursed in vain.”<br><br>  The lady ceased.

So counselled to her bane<br>Disguised beneath a show of gain,<br>Kaikeyí in her joy and pride<br>To Manthará again replied:<br>“Thy sense I envy, prudent maid;<br>With sagest lore thy lids persuade.<br>No hump-back maid in all the earth,<br>For wise resolve, can match thy worth.<br>Thou art alone with constant zeal<br>Devoted to thy lady’s weal.<br>Dear girl, without thy faithful aid<br>I had not marked the plot he laid.<br>Full of all guile and sin and spite<br>Misshapen hump-backs shock the sight:<br>But thou art fair and formed to please,<br>Bent like a lily by the breeze.<br>I look thee o’er with watchful eye,<br>And in thy frame no fault can spy;<br>The chest so deep, the waist so trim,<br>So round the lines of breast and limb.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">In these four lines I do not translate faithfully, and I do not
