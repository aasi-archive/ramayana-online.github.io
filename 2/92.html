                            So Bharat with his army spent<br>The watches of the night content,<br>And gladly, with the morning’s light<br>Drew near his host the anchorite.<br>When Bharadvája saw him stand<br>With hand in reverence joined to hand,<br>When fires of worship had been fed,<br>He looked upon the prince and said:<br>“O blameless son, I pray thee tell,<br>Did the past night content thee well?<br>Say if the feast my care supplied<br>Thy host of followers gratified.”<br><br>  His hands he joined, his head he bent<br>And spoke in answer reverent<br>To the most high and radiant sage<br>Who issued from his hermitage:<br>“Well have I passed the night: thy feast<br>Gave joy to every man and beast;<br>And I, great lord, and every peer<br>Were satisfied with sumptuous cheer,<br>Thy banquet has delighted all<br>From highest chief to meanest thrall,<br>And rich attire and drink and meat<br>Banished the thought of toil and heat.<br>And now, O Hermit good and great,<br>A boon of thee I supplicate.<br>To Ráma’s side my steps I bend:<br>Do thou with friendly eye commend.<br>O tell me how to guide my feet<br>To virtuous Ráma’s lone retreat:<br>Great Hermit, I entreat thee, say<br>How far from here and which the way.”<br><br>  Thus by fraternal love inspired<br>The chieftain of the saint inquired:<br>Then thus replied the glorious seer<br>Of matchless might, of vows austere:<br>“Ere the fourth league from here be passed,<br>Amid a forest wild and vast,<br>Stands Chitrakúṭa’s mountain tall,<br>Lovely with wood and waterfall.<br>North of the mountain thou wilt see<br>The beauteous stream Mandákiní,<br>Where swarm the waterfowl below,<br>And gay trees on the margin grow.<br>Then will a leafy cot between<br>The river and the hill be seen:<br>’Tis Ráma’s, and the princely pair<br>Of brothers live for certain there.<br>Hence to the south thine army lead,<br>And then more southward still proceed,<br>So shalt thou find his lone retreat,<br>And there the son of Raghu meet.”<br><br>  Soon as the ordered march they knew,<br>The widows of the monarch flew,<br>Leaving their cars, most meet to ride,<br>And flocked to Bharadvája’s side.<br>There with the good Sumitrá Queen<br>Kauśalyá, sad and worn, was seen,<br>Caressing, still with sorrow faint,<br>The feet of that illustrious saint,<br>Kaikeyí too, her longings crossed,<br>Reproached of all, her object lost,<br>Before the famous hermit came,<br>And clasped his feet, o’erwhelmed with shame.<br>With circling steps she humbly went<br>Around the saint preëminent,<br>And stood not far from Bharat’s side<br>With heart oppressed, and heavy-eyed.<br>Then the great seer, who never broke<br>One holy vow, to Bharat spoke:<br>“Speak, Raghu’s son: I fain would learn<br>The story of each queen in turn.”<br><br>  Obedient to the high request<br>By Bharadvája thus addressed,<br>His reverent hands together laid,<br>He, skilled in speech, his answer made:<br>“She whom, O Saint, thou seest here<br>A Goddess in her form appear,<br>Was the chief consort of the king,<br>Now worn with fast and sorrowing.<br>As Aditi in days of yore<br>The all-preserving Vishṇu bore,<br>Kauśalyá bore with happy fate<br>Lord Ráma of the lion’s gait.<br>She who, transfixed with torturing pangs,<br>On her left arm so fondly hangs,<br>As when her withering leaves decay<br>Droops by the wood the Cassia spray,<br>Sumitrá, pained with woe, is she,<br>The consort second of the three:<br>Two princely sons the lady bare,<br>Fair as the Gods in heaven are fair.<br>And she, the wicked dame through whom<br>My brothers’ lives are wrapped in gloom,<br>And mourning for his offspring dear,<br>The king has sought his heavenly sphere,—<br>Proud, foolish-hearted, swift to ire,<br>Self-fancied darling of my sire,<br>Kaikeyí, most ambitious queen,<br>Unlovely with her lovely mien,<br>My mother she, whose impious will<br>Is ever bent on deeds of ill,<br>In whom the root and spring I see<br>Of all this woe which crushes me.”<br><br>  Quick breathing like a furious snake,<br>With tears and sobs the hero spake,<br>With reddened eyes aglow with rage.<br>And Bharadvája, mighty sage,<br>Supreme in wisdom, calm and grave,<br>In words like these good counsel gave:<br>“O Bharat, hear the words I say;<br>On her the fault thou must not lay:<br>For many a blessing yet will spring<br>From banished Ráma’s wandering.”<br>And Bharat, with that promise cheered,<br>Went circling round that saint revered,<br>He humbly bade farewell, and then<br>Gave orders to collect his men.<br>Prompt at the summons thousands flew<br>To cars which noble coursers drew,<br>Bright-gleaming, glorious to behold,<br>Adorned with wealth of burnished gold.<br>Then female elephants and male,<br>Gold-girthed, with flags that wooed the gale,<br>Marched with their bright bells’ tinkling chime<br>Like clouds when ends the summer time:<br>Some cars were huge and some were light,<br>For heavy draught or rapid flight,<br>Of costly price, of every kind,<br>With clouds of infantry behind.<br>The dames, Kauśalyá at their head,<br>Were in the noblest chariots led,<br>And every gentle bosom beat<br>With hope the banished prince to meet.<br>The royal Bharat, glory-crowned,<br>With all his retinue around,<br>Borne in a beauteous litter rode,<br>Like the young moon and sun that glowed.<br>The army as it streamed along,<br>Cars, elephants, in endless throng,<br>Showed, marching on its southward way,<br>Like autumn clouds in long array.
