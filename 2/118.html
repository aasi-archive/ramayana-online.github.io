                            Thus by the holy dame addressed<br>Who banished envy from her breast,<br>Her lowly reverence Sítá paid,<br>And softly thus her answer made:<br>“No marvel, best of dames, thy speech<br>The duties of a wife should teach;<br>Yet I, O lady, also know<br>Due reverence to my lord to show.<br>Were he the meanest of the base,<br>Unhonoured with a single grace,<br>My husband still I ne’er would leave,<br>But firm through all to him would cleave:<br>Still rather to a lord like mine<br>Whose virtues high-exalted shine,<br>Compassionate, of lofty soul,<br>With every sense in due control,<br>True in his love, of righteous mind,<br>Like a dear sire and mother kind.<br>E’en as he ever loves to treat<br>Kauśalyá with observance meet,<br>Has his behaviour ever been<br>To every other honoured queen.<br>Nay, more, a sonlike reverence shows<br>The noble Ráma e’en to those<br>On whom the king his father set<br>His eyes one moment, to forget.<br>Deep in my heart the words are stored,<br>Said by the mother of my lord,<br>When from my home I turned away<br>In the lone fearful woods to stray.<br>The counsel of my mother deep<br>Impressed upon my soul I keep,<br>When by the fire I took my stand,<br>And Ráma clasped in his my hand.<br>And in my bosom cherished yet,<br>My friends’ advice I ne’er forget:<br>Woman her holiest offering pays<br>When she her husband’s will obeys.<br>Good Sávitrí her lord obeyed,<br>And a high saint in heaven was made,<br>And for the self-same virtue thou<br>Hast heaven in thy possession now.<br>And she with whom no dame could vie,<br>Now a bright Goddess in the sky,<br>Sweet Rohiṇí the Moon’s dear Queen,<br>Without her lord is never seen:<br>And many a faithful wife beside<br>For her pure love is glorified.”<br><br>  Thus Sítá spake: soft rapture stole<br>Through Anasúyá’s saintly soul:<br>Kisses on Sítá’s head she pressed,<br>And thus the Maithil dame addressed:<br>“I by long rites and toils endured<br>Rich store of merit have secured:<br>From this my wealth will I bestow<br>A blessing ere I let thee go.<br>So right and wise and true each word<br>That from thy lips mine ears have heard,<br>I love thee: be my pleasing task<br>To grant the boon that thou shalt ask.”<br><br>  Then Sítá marvelled much, and while<br>Played o’er her lips a gentle smile,<br>“All has been done, O Saint,” she cried,<br>“And naught remains to wish beside.”<br><br>  She spake; the lady’s meek reply<br>Swelled Anasúyá’s rapture high.<br>“Sítá,” she said, “my gift to-day<br>Thy sweet contentment shall repay.<br>Accept this precious robe to wear,<br>Of heavenly fabric, rich and rare,<br>These gems thy limbs to ornament,<br>This precious balsam sweet of scent.<br>O Maithil dame, this gift of mine<br>Shall make thy limbs with beauty shine,<br>And breathing o’er thy frame dispense<br>Its pure and lasting influence.<br>This balsam on thy fair limbs spread<br>New radiance on thy lord shall shed,<br>As Lakshmí’s beauty lends a grace<br>To Vishṇu’s own celestial face.”<br><br>  Then Sítá took the gift the dame<br>Bestowed on her in friendship’s name,<br>The balsam, gems, and robe divine,<br>And garlands wreathed of bloomy twine;<br>Then sat her down, with reverence meet,<br>At saintly Anasúyá’s feet.<br>The matron rich in rites and vows<br>Turned her to Ráma’s Maithil spouse,<br>And questioned thus in turn to hear<br>A pleasant tale to charm her ear:<br>“Sítá, ’tis said that Raghu’s son<br>Thy hand, mid gathered suitors, won.<br>I fain would hear thee, lady, tell<br>The story as it all befell:<br>Do thou repeat each thing that passed,<br>Reviewing all from first to last.”<br><br>  Thus spake the dame to Sítá: she<br>Replying to the devotee,<br>“Then, lady, thy attention lend,”<br>Rehearsed the story to the end:<br><br>  “King Janak, just and brave and strong,<br>Who loves the right and hates the wrong,<br>Well skilled in what the law ordains<br>For Warriors, o’er Videha reigns.<br>Guiding one morn the plough, his hand<br>Marked out, for rites the sacred land,<br>When, as the ploughshare cleft the earth,<br>Child of the king I leapt to birth.<br>Then as the ground he smoothed and cleared,<br>He saw me all with dust besmeared,<br>And on the new-found babe, amazed<br>The ruler of Videha gazed.<br>In childless love the monarch pressed<br>The welcome infant to his breast:<br>“My daughter,” thus he cried, “is she:”<br>And as his child he cared for me.<br>Forth from the sky was heard o’erhead<br>As ’twere a human voice that said:<br>“Yea, even so: great King, this child<br>Henceforth thine own be justly styled.”<br>Videha’s monarch, virtuous souled,<br>Rejoiced o’er me with joy untold,<br>Delighting in his new-won prize,<br>The darling of his heart and eyes.<br>To his chief queen of saintly mind<br>The precious treasure he consigned,<br>And by her side she saw me grow,<br>Nursed with the love which mothers know.<br>Then as he saw the seasons fly,<br>And knew my marriage-time was nigh,<br>My sire was vexed with care, as sad<br>As one who mourns the wealth he had:<br>“Scorn on the maiden’s sire must wait<br>From men of high and low estate:<br>The virgin’s father all despise,<br>Though Indra’s peer, who rules the skies.”<br>More near he saw, and still more near,<br>The scorn that filled his soul with fear,<br>On trouble’s billowy ocean tossed,<br>Like one whose shattered bark is lost.<br>My father knowing how I came,<br>No daughter of a mortal dame,<br>In all the regions failed to see<br>A bridegroom meet to match with me.<br>Each way with anxious thought he scanned,<br>And thus at length the monarch planned:<br>“The Bride’s Election will I hold,<br>With every rite prescribed of old.”<br>It pleased King Varuṇ to bestow<br>Quiver and shafts and heavenly bow<br>Upon my father’s sire who reigned,<br>When Daksha his great rite ordained.<br>Where was the man might bend or lift<br>With utmost toil that wondrous gift?<br>Not e’en in dreams could mortal king<br>Strain the great bow or draw the string.<br>Of this tremendous bow possessed,<br>My truthful father thus addressed<br>The lords of many a region, all<br>Assembled at the monarch’s call:<br>“Whoe’er this bow can manage, he<br>The husband of my child shall be.”<br>The suitors viewed with hopeless eyes<br>That wondrous bow of mountain size,<br>Then to my sire they bade adieu,<br>And all with humbled hearts withdrew.<br>At length with Viśvámitra came<br>This son of Raghu, dear to fame,<br>The royal sacrifice to view.<br>Near to my father’s home he drew,<br>His brother Lakshmaṇ by his side,<br>Ráma, in deeds heroic tried.<br>My sire with honour entertained<br>The saint in lore of duty trained,<br>Who thus in turn addressed the king:<br>“Ráma and Lakshmaṇ here who spring<br>From royal Daśaratha, long<br>To see thy bow so passing strong.”<br><br>  Before the prince’s eyes was laid<br>That marvel, as the Bráhman prayed.<br>One moment on the bow he gazed,<br>Quick to the notch the string he raised,<br>Then, in the wandering people’s view,<br>The cord with mighty force he drew.<br>Then with an awful crash as loud<br>As thunderbolts that cleave the cloud,<br>The bow beneath the matchless strain<br>Of arms heroic snapped in twain.<br>Thus, giving purest water, he,<br>My sire, to Ráma offered me.<br>The prince the offered gift declined<br>Till he should learn his father’s mind;<br>So horsemen swift Ayodhyá sought<br>And back her aged monarch brought.<br>Me then my sire to Ráma gave,<br>Self-ruled, the bravest of the brave.<br>And Urmilá, the next to me,<br>Graced with all gifts, most fair to see,<br>My sire with Raghu’s house allied,<br>And gave her to be Lakshmaṇ’s bride.<br>Thus from the princes of the land<br>Lord Ráma won my maiden hand,<br>And him exalted high above<br>Heroic chiefs I truly love.”
