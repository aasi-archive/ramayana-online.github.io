                            She thought upon her lord and sighed,<br>And thus in gentle tones replied:<br>“Beseems thee not, O King, to woo<br>A matron, to her husband true.<br>Thus vainly one might hope by sin<br>And evil deeds success to win.<br>Shall I, so highly born, disgrace<br>My husband’s house, my royal race?<br>Shall I, a true and loyal dame,<br>Defile my soul with deed of shame?”<br><br>  Then on the king her back she turned,<br>And answered thus the prayer she spurned:<br>“Turn, Rávaṇ, turn thee from thy sin;<br>Seek virtue’s paths and walk therein.<br>To others dames be honour shown;<br>Protect them as thou wouldst thine own.<br>Taught by thyself, from wrong abstain<br>Which, wrought on thee, thy heart would pain.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Do unto others as thou wouldst they should do unto thee, is a
precept frequently occurring in the old Indian poems. This charity
is to embrace not human beings only, but bird and beast as well: “He
prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small.”

</span></span><br>Beware: this lawless love of thine<br>Will ruin thee and all thy line;<br>And for thy sin, thy sin alone,<br>Will Lanká perish overthrown.<br>Dream not that wealth and power can sway<br>My heart from duty’s path to stray.<br>Linked like the Day-God and his shine,<br>I am my lord’s and he is mine.<br>Repent thee of thine impious deed;<br>To Ráma’s side his consort lead.<br>Be wise; the hero’s friendship gain,<br>Nor perish in his fury slain.<br>Go, ask the God of Death to spare,<br>Or red bolt flashing through the air,<br>But look in vain for spell or charm<br>To stay my Ráma’s vengeful arm.<br>Thou, when the hero bends his bow,<br>Shalt hear the clang that heralds woe,<br>Loud as the clash when clouds are rent<br>And Indra’s bolt to earth is sent.<br>Then shall his furious shafts be sped,<br>Each like a snake with fiery head,<br>And in their flight shall hiss and flame<br>Marked with the mighty archer’s name.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">It was the custom of Indian warriors to mark their arrows with their
ciphers or names, and it seems to have been regarded as a point of
honour to give an enemy the satisfaction of knowing who had shot at
him. This passage however contains, if my memory serves me well, the
first mention in the poem of this practice, and as arrows have been
so frequently mentioned and described with almost every conceivable
epithet, its occurrence here seems suspicious. No mention of, or
allusion to writing has hitherto occurred in the poem.
