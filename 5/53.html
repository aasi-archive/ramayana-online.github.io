                            King Rávaṇ, by his pleading moved,<br>The counsel of the chief approved:<br>“Thy words are wise and true: to kill<br>An envoy would beseem us ill.<br>Yet must we for his crime invent<br>Some fitting mode of punishment.<br>The tail, I fancy, is the part<br>Most cherished by a monkey’s heart.<br>Make ready: set his tail aflame,<br>And let him leave us as he came,<br>And thus disfigured and disgraced<br>Back to his king and people haste.”<br><br>  The giants heard their monarch’s speech;<br>And, filled with burning fury, each<br>Brought strips of cotton cloth, and round<br>The monkey’s tail the bandage wound.<br>As round his tail the bands they drew<br>His mighty form dilating grew<br>Vast as the flame that bursts on high<br>Where trees are old and grass is dry.<br>Each band and strip they soaked in oil,<br>And set on fire the twisted coil.<br>Delighted as they viewed the blaze,<br>The cruel demons stood at gaze:<br>And mid loud drums and shells rang out<br>The triumph of their joyful shout.<br>They pressed about him thick and fast<br>As through the crowded streets he passed,<br>Observing with attentive care<br>Each rich and wondrous structure there,<br>Still heedless of the eager cry<br>That rent the air, The spy! the spy!<br><br>  Some to the captive lady ran,<br>And thus in joyous words began:<br>“That copper-visaged monkey, he<br>Who in the garden talked with thee,<br>Through Lanká’s town is led a show,<br>And round his tail the red flames glow.”<br>The mournful news the lady heard<br>That with fresh grief her bosom stirred.<br>Swift to the kindled fire she went<br>And prayed before it reverent:<br>“If I my husband have obeyed,<br>And kept the ascetic vows I made,<br>Free, ever free, from stain and blot,<br>O spare the Vánar; harm him not.”<br><br>  Then leapt on high the flickering flame<br>And shone in answer to the dame.<br>The pitying fire its rage forbore:<br>The Vánar felt the heat no more.<br>Then, to minutest size reduced,<br>The bonds that bound his limbs he loosed,<br>And, freed from every band and chain,<br>Rose to his native size again.<br>He seized a club of ponderous weight<br>That lay before him by the gate,<br>Rushed at the fiends that hemmed him round,<br>And laid them lifeless on the ground.<br>Through Lanká’s town again he strode,<br>And viewed each street and square and road,—<br>Still wreathed about with harmless blaze,<br>A sun engarlanded with rays.
