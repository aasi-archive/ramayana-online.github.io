                            He looked upon the burning waste,<br>Then sought the queen in joyous haste,<br>With words of hope consoled her heart,<br>And made him ready to depart.<br>He scaled Arishṭa’s glorious steep<br>Whose summits beetled o’er the deep.<br>The woods in varied beauty dressed<br>Hung like a garland round his crest,<br>And clouds of ever changing hue<br>A robe about his shoulders threw.<br>On him the rays of morning fell<br>To wake the hill they loved so well,<br>And bid unclose those splendid eyes<br>That glittered in his mineral dyes.<br>He woke to hear the music made<br>By thunders of the white cascade,<br>While every laughing rill that sprang<br>From crag to crag its carol sang.<br>For arms, he lifted to the stars<br>His towering stems of Deodárs,<br>And morning heard his pealing call<br>In tumbling brook and waterfall.<br>He trembled when his woods were pale<br>And bowed beneath the autumn gale,<br>And when his vocal reeds were stirred<br>His melancholy moan was heard.<br><br>  Far down against the mountain’s feet<br>The Vánar heard the wild waves beat;<br>Then turned his glances to the north.<br>Sprang from the peak and bounded forth,<br>The mountain felt the fearful shock<br>And trembled through his mass of rock.<br>The tallest trees were crushed and rent<br>And headlong to the valley sent,<br>And as the rocking shook each cave<br>Loud was the roar the lions gave.<br>Forth from the shaken cavern came<br>Fierce serpents with their tongues aflame;<br>And every Yaksha, wild with dread,<br>And Kinnar and Gandharva, fled.
