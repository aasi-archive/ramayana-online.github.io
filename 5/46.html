                            Mad with the rage of injured pride<br>King Rávaṇ summoned to his side<br>The valiant five who led his host,<br>Supreme in war and honoured most.<br>“Go forth,” he cried, “with car and steed,<br>And to my feet this monkey lead,<br>But watch each chance of time and place<br>To seize this thing of silvan race.<br>For from his wondrous exploits he<br>No monkey of the woods can be,<br>But some new kind of creature meant<br>To work us woe, by Indra sent.<br>Gandharvas, Nágas, and the best<br>Of Yakshas have our might confessed.<br>Have we not challenged and subdued<br>The whole celestial multitude?<br>Yet will you not, if you are wise,<br>A chief of monkey race despise.<br>For I myself have Báli known,<br>And King Sugríva’s power I own.<br>But none of all their woodland throng<br>Was half so terrible and strong.”<br><br>  Obedient to the words he spake<br>They hastened forth the foe to take.<br>Swift were the cars whereon they rode,<br>And bright their weapons flashed and glowed.<br>They saw: they charged in wild career<br>With sword and mace and axe and spear.<br>From Durdhar’s bow five arrows sped<br>And quivered in the Vánar’s head.<br>He rose and roared: the fearful sound<br>Made all the region echo round.<br>Then from above his weight he threw<br>On Durdhar’s car that near him drew.<br>The weight that came with lightning speed<br>Crushed pole and axle, car and steed.<br>It shattered Durdhar’s head and neck,<br>And left him lifeless mid the wreck.<br>Yúpáksha saw the warrior die,<br>And Virúpáksha heard his cry,<br>And, mad for vengeance for the slain,<br>They charged their Vánar foe again.<br>He rose in air: they onward pressed<br>And fiercely smote him on the breast.<br>In vain they struck his iron frame:<br>With eagle swoop to earth he came,<br>Tore from the ground a tree that grew<br>Beside him, and the demons slew.<br>Then Bhásakama raised his spear,<br>And Praghas with a laugh drew near,<br>And, maddened at the sight, the two<br>Against the undaunted Vánar flew.<br>As from his wounds the torrents flowed,<br>Like a red sun the Vánar showed.<br>He turned, a mountain peak to seize<br>With all its beasts and snakes and trees.<br>He hurled it on the pair: and they<br>Crushed, overwhelmed, beneath it lay.
