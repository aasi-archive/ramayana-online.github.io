air. The moon is its lotus, the sun its wild-duck, the clouds are
its water-weeds, Mars is its shark and so on. Gorresio remarks:
“This comparison of a great lake to the sky and of celestial to
aquatic objects is one of those ideas which the view and qualities
of natural scenery awake in lively fancies. Imagine one of those
grand and splendid lakes of India covered with lotus blossoms,
furrowed by wild-ducks of the most vivid colours, mantled over here
and there with flowers and water weeds &c. and it will be understood
how the fancy of the poet could readily compare to the sky radiant
with celestial azure the blue expanse of the water, to the soft
light of the moon the inner hue of the lotus, to the splendour of
the sun the brilliant colours of the wild-fowl, to the stars the
flowers, to the cloud the weeds that float upon the water &c.”
