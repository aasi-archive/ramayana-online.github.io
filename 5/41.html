said to be four: conciliation, gifts, disunion, and force or
punishment. Hanumán considers it useless to employ the first three
and resolves to punish Rávaṇ by destroying his pleasure-grounds.

</span></span><br>These dwellers in the giants’ isle<br>No arts of mine can reconcile.<br>I cannot bribe: I cannot sow<br>Dissension mid the Rákshas foe.<br>Arts, gifts, address, these fiends despise;<br>But force shall yet their king chastise.<br>Perchance he may relent when all<br>The bravest of his chieftains fall.<br>This lovely grove will I destroy,<br>The cruel Rávaṇ’s pride and joy.<br>The garden where he takes his ease<br>Mid climbing plants and flowery trees<br>That lift their proud tops to the skies,<br>Dear to the tyrant as his eyes.<br>Then will he rouse in wrath, and lead<br>His legions with the car and steed<br>And elephants in long array,<br>And seek me thirsty for the fray.<br>The Rákshas legions will I meet,<br>And all his bravest host defeat;<br>Then, glorious from the bloody plain,<br>Turn to my lord the king again.”<br><br>  Then every lovely tree that bore<br>Fair blossoms, from the soil he tore,<br>Till each green bough that lent its shade<br>To singing birds on earth was laid.<br>The wilderness he left a waste,<br>The fountains shattered and defaced:<br>O’erthrew and levelled with the ground<br>Each shady seat and pleasure-mound.<br>Each arbour clad with climbing bloom,<br>Each grotto, cell, and picture room,<br>Each lawn by beast and bird enjoyed,<br>Each walk and terrace was destroyed.<br>And all the place that was so fair<br>Was left a ruin wild and bare,<br>As if the fury of the blast<br>Or raging fire had o’er it passed.
