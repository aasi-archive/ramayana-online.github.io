spoken by women of the upper classes at the time when the Rámáyaṇa
was written (whenever that may have been), was at least understood
by them, and was commonly spoken by men of the priestly class, and
other educated persons. By the Sanskrit proper to an [ordinary] man,
alluded to in the second passage, may perhaps be understood not a
language in which words different from Sanskrit were used, but the
employment of formal and elaborate diction.” MUIR’S<em>&nbsp;Sanskrit
