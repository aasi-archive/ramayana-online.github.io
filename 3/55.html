                            Thus Rávaṇ his commandment gave<br>To those eight giants strong and brave,<br>So thinking in his foolish pride<br>Against all dangers to provide.<br>Then with his wounded heart aflame<br>With love he thought upon the dame,<br>And took with hasty steps the way<br>To the fair chamber where she lay.<br>He saw the gentle lady there<br>Weighed down by woe too great to bear,<br>Amid the throng of fiends who kept<br>Their watch around her as she wept:<br>A pinnace sinking neath the wave<br>When mighty winds around her rave:<br>A lonely herd-forsaken deer,<br>When hungry dogs are pressing near.<br>Within the bower the giant passed:<br>Her mournful looks were downward cast.<br>As there she lay with streaming eyes<br>The giant bade the lady rise,<br>And to the shrinking captive showed<br>The glories of his rich abode,<br>Where thousand women spent their days<br>In palaces with gold ablaze;<br>Where wandered birds of every sort,<br>And jewels flashed in hall and court.<br>Where noble pillars charmed the sight<br>With diamond and lazulite,<br>And others glorious to behold<br>With ivory, crystal, silver, gold.<br>There swelled on high the tambour’s sound,<br>And burnished ore was bright around<br>He led the mournful lady where<br>Resplendent gold adorned the stair,<br>And showed each lattice fair to see<br>With silver work and ivory:<br>Showed his bright chambers, line on line,<br>Adorned with nets of golden twine.<br>Beyond he showed the Maithil dame<br>His gardens bright as lightning’s flame,<br>And many a pool and lake he showed<br>Where blooms of gayest colour glowed.<br>Through all his home from view to view<br>The lady sunk in grief he drew.<br>Then trusting in her heart to wake<br>Desire of all she saw, he spake:<br>“Three hundred million giants, all<br>Obedient to their master’s call,<br>Not counting young and weak and old,<br>Serve me with spirits fierce and bold.<br>A thousand culled from all of these<br>Wait on the lord they long to please.<br>This glorious power, this pomp and sway,<br>Dear lady, at thy feet I lay:<br>Yea, with my life I give the whole,<br>O dearer than my life and soul.<br>A thousand beauties fill my hall:<br>Be thou my wife and rule them all.<br>O hear my supplication! why<br>This reasonable prayer deny?<br>Some pity to thy suitor show,<br>For love’s hot flames within me glow.<br>This isle a hundred leagues in length,<br>Encompassed by the ocean’s strength,<br>Would all the Gods and fiends defy<br>Though led by Him who rules the sky.<br>No God in heaven, no sage on earth,<br>No minstrel of celestial birth,<br>No spirit in the worlds I see<br>A match in power and might for me.<br>What wilt thou do with Ráma, him<br>Whose days are short, whose light is dim,<br>Expelled from home and royal sway,<br>Who treads on foot his weary way?<br>Leave the poor mortal to his fate,<br>And wed thee with a worthier mate.<br>My timid love, enjoy with me<br>The prime of youth before it flee.<br>Do not one hour the hope retain<br>To look on Ráma’s face again.<br>For whom would wildest thought beguile<br>To seek thee in the giants’ isle?<br>Say who is he has power to bind<br>In toils of net the rushing wind.<br>Whose is the mighty hand will tame<br>And hold the glory of the flame?<br>In all the worlds above, below,<br>Not one, O fair of form, I know<br>Who from this isle in fight could rend<br>The lady whom these arms defend.<br>Fair Queen, o’er Lanká’s island reign,<br>Sole mistress of the wide domain.<br>Gods, rovers of the night like me,<br>And all the world thy slaves will be.<br>O’er thy fair brows and queenly head<br>Let consecrating balm be shed,<br>And sorrow banished from thy breast,<br>Enjoy my love and take thy rest.<br>Here never more thy soul shall know<br>The memory of thy former woe,<br>And here shall thou enjoy the meed<br>Deserved by every virtuous deed.<br>Here garlands glow of flowery twine,<br>With gorgeous hues and scent divine.<br>Take gold and gems and rich attire:<br>Enjoy with me thy heart’s desire.<br>There stand, of chariots far the best,<br>The car my brother once possessed.<br>Which, victor in the stricken field,<br>I forced the Lord of Gold to yield.<br>’Tis wide and high and nobly wrought,<br>Bright as the sun and swift as thought.<br>Therein O Sítá, shalt thou ride<br>Delighted by thy lover’s side.<br>But sorrow mars with lingering trace<br>The splendour of thy lotus face.<br>A cloud of woe is o’er it spread,<br>And all the light of joy is fled.”<br><br>  The lady, by her woe distressed,<br>One corner of her raiment pressed<br>To her sad cheek like moonlight clear,<br>And wiped away a falling tear.<br>The rover of the night renewed<br>His eager pleading as he viewed<br>The lady stand like one distraught,<br>Striving to fix her wandering thought:<br><br>  “Think not, sweet lady, of the shame<br>Of broken vows, nor fear the blame.<br>The saints approve with favouring eyes<br>This union knit with marriage ties.<br>O beauty, at thy radiant feet<br>I lay my heads, and thus entreat.<br>One word of grace, one look I crave:<br>Have pity on thy prostrate slave.<br>These idle words I speak are vain,<br>Wrung forth by love’s consuming pain,<br>And ne’er of Rávaṇ be it said<br>He wooed a dame with prostrate head.”<br>Thus to the Maithil lady sued<br>The monarch of the giant brood,<br>And “She is now mine own,” he thought,<br>In Death’s dire coils already caught.
