                            When Khara saw his sister lie<br>With blood-stained limbs and troubled eye,<br>Wild fury in his bosom woke,<br>And thus the monstrous giant spoke;<br><br>  “Arise, my sister; cast away<br>This numbing terror and dismay,<br>And straight the impious hand declare<br>That marred those features once so fair.<br>For who his finger tip will lay<br>On the black snake in childish play,<br>And unattacked, with idle stroke<br>His poison-laden fang provoke?<br>Ill-fated fool, he little knows<br>Death’s noose around his neck he throws,<br>Who rashly met thee, and a draught<br>Of life-destroying poison quaffed.<br>Strong, fierce as death, ’twas thine to choose<br>Thy way at will, each shape to use;<br>In power and might like one of us:<br>What hand has maimed and marred thee thus?<br>What God or fiend this deed has wrought,<br>What bard or sage of lofty thought<br>Was armed with power supremely great<br>Thy form to mar and mutilate?<br>In all the worlds not one I see<br>Would dare a deed to anger me:<br>Not Indra’s self, the Thousand-eyed,<br>Beneath whose hand fierce Páka<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">A demon slain by Indra.

</span></span> race.<br>There by these wondering eyes between<br>The noble youths a dame was seen,<br>Fair, blooming, young, with dainty waist,<br>And all her bright apparel graced.<br>For her with ready heart and mind<br>The royal pair their strength combined,<br>And brought me to this last distress,<br>Like some lost woman, comfortless.<br>Perfidious wretch! my soul is fain<br>Her foaming blood and theirs to drain.<br>O let me head the vengeful fight,<br>And with this hand my murderers smite.<br>Come, brother, hasten to fulfil<br>This longing of my eager will.<br>On to the battle! Let me drink<br>Their lifeblood as to earth they sink.”<br><br>  Then Khara, by his sister pressed,<br>Inflamed with fury, gave his hest<br>To twice seven giants of his crew,<br>Fierce as the God of death to view:<br><br>  ’Two men equipped with arms, who wear<br>Deerskin and bark and matted hair,<br>Leading a beauteous dame, have strayed<br>To the wild gloom of Daṇḍak’s shade.<br>These men, this cursed woman slay,<br>And hasten back without delay,<br>That this my sister’s lips may be<br>Red with the lifeblood of the three.<br>Giants, my wounded sister longs<br>To take this vengeance for her wrongs.<br>With speed her dearest wish fulfil,<br>And with your might these creatures kill.<br>Soon as your matchless strength shall lay<br>These brothers dead in battle fray,<br>She in triumphant joy will laugh,<br>And their hearts’ blood delighted quaff.”<br><br>  The giants heard the words he said,<br>And forth with Śúrpaṇakhá sped,<br>As mighty clouds in autumn fly<br>Urged by the wind along the sky.
