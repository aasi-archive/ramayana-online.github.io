but she<br>Was cold and deaf to every plea.<br>As yet my days are few; eighteen<br>The years of life that I have seen;<br>And Ráma, best of all alive,<br>Has passed of years a score and five—<br>Ráma the great and gentle, through<br>All region famed as pure and true,<br>Large-eyed and mighty-armed and tall,<br>With tender heart that cares for all.<br>But Daśaratha, led astray<br>By woman’s wile and passion’s sway,<br>By his strong love of her impelled,<br>The consecrating rites withheld.<br>When, hopeful of the promised grace,<br>My Ráma sought his father’s face,<br>The queen Kaikeyí, ill at ease,<br>Spoke to my lord brief words like these:<br>“Hear, son of Raghu, hear from me<br>The words thy father says to thee:<br>“I yield this day to Bharat’s hand,<br>Free from all foes, this ancient land.<br>Fly from this home no longer thine,<br>And dwell in woods five years and nine.<br>Live in the forest and maintain<br>Mine honour pure from falsehood’s stain.’ ”<br>Then Ráma spoke, untouched by dread:<br>“Yea, it shall be as thou hast said.”<br>And answered, faithful to his vows,<br>Obeying Daśaratha’s spouse:<br>“The offered realm I would not take,<br>But still keep true the words he spake.”<br>Thus, gentle Bráhman, Ráma still<br>Clung to his vow with firmest will.<br>And valiant Lakshmaṇ, dear to fame,<br>His brother by a younger dame,<br>Bold victor in the deadly fray,<br>Would follow Ráma on his way.<br>On sternest vows his heart was set,<br>And he, a youthful anchoret,<br>Bound up in twisted coil his hair<br>And took the garb which hermits wear;<br>Then with his bow to guard us, he<br>Went forth with Ráma and with me.<br>By Queen Kaikeyí’s art bereft<br>The kingdom and our home we left,<br>And bound by stern religious vows<br>We sought this shade of forest boughs.<br>Now, best of Bráhmans, here we tread<br>These pathless regions dark and dread.<br>But come, refresh thy soul, and rest<br>Here for a while an honoured guest,<br>For he, my lord, will soon be here<br>With fresh supply of woodland cheer,<br>Large store of venison of the buck,<br>Or some great boar his hand has struck.<br>Meanwhile, O stranger, grant my prayer:<br>Thy name, thy race, thy birth declare,<br>And why with no companion thou<br>Roamest in Daṇḍak forest now.”<br><br>  Thus questioned Sítá, Ráma’s dame.<br>Then fierce the stranger’s answer came:<br>“Lord of the giant legions, he<br>From whom celestial armies flee,—<br>The dread of hell and earth and sky,<br>Rávaṇ the Rákshas king am I.<br>Now when thy gold-like form I view<br>Arrayed in silks of amber hue,<br>My love, O thou of perfect mould,<br>For all my dames is dead and cold.<br>A thousand fairest women, torn<br>From many a land my home adorn.<br>But come, loveliest lady, be<br>The queen of every dame and me.<br>My city Lanká, glorious town,<br>Looks from a mountain’s forehead down<br>Where ocean with his flash and foam<br>Beats madly on mine island home.<br>With me, O Sítá, shalt thou rove<br>Delighted through each shady grove,<br>Nor shall thy happy breast retain<br>Fond memory of this life of pain.<br>In gay attire, a glittering band,<br>Five thousand maids shall round thee stand,<br>And serve thee at thy beck and sign,<br>If thou, fair Sítá, wilt be mine.”<br><br>  Then forth her noble passion broke<br>As thus in turn the lady spoke:<br>“Me, me the wife of Ráma, him<br>The lion lord with lion’s limb,<br>Strong as the sea, firm as the rock,<br>Like Indra in the battle shock.<br>The lord of each auspicious sign,<br>The glory of his princely line,<br>Like some fair Bodh tree strong and tall,<br>The noblest and the best of all,<br>Ráma, the heir of happy fate<br>Who keeps his word inviolate,<br>Lord of the lion gait, possessed<br>Of mighty arm and ample chest,<br>Ráma the lion-warrior, him<br>Whose moon bright face no fear can dim,<br>Ráma, his bridled passions’ lord,<br>The darling whom his sire adored,—<br>Me, me the true and loving dame<br>Of Ráma, prince of deathless fame—<br>Me wouldst thou vainly woo and press?<br>A jackal woo a lioness!<br>Steal from the sun his glory! such<br>Thy hope Lord Ráma’s wife to touch.<br>Ha! Thou hast seen the trees of gold,<br>The sign which dying eyes behold,<br>Thus seeking, weary of thy life,<br>To win the love of Ráma’s wife.<br>Fool! wilt thou dare to rend away<br>The famished lion’s bleeding prey,<br>Or from the threatening jaws to take<br>The fang of some envenomed snake?<br>What, wouldst thou shake with puny hand<br>Mount Mandar,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The mountain which was used by the Gods as a churning stick at the

Her gentle cheek grew pale,<br>Her loosened limbs began to fail,<br>And like a plantain in the gale<br>  She trembled with affright.<br>He terrible as Death stood nigh,<br>And watched with fierce exulting eye<br>  The fear that shook her frame.<br>To terrify the lady more,<br>He counted all his triumphs o’er,<br>Proclaimed the titles that he bore,<br>  His pedigree and name.
