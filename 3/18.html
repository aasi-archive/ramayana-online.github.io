                            On her ensnared in Káma’s net<br>His eyes the royal Ráma set,<br>And thus, her passion to beguile,<br>Addressed her with a gentle smile:<br><br>  “I have a wife: behold her here,<br>My Sítá ever true and dear:<br>And one like thee will never brook<br>Upon a rival spouse to look.<br>But there my brother Lakshmaṇ stands:<br>Unchained is he by nuptial bands:<br>A youth heroic, loved of all,<br>Gracious and gallant, fair and tall.<br>With winning looks, most nobly bred,<br>Unmatched till now, he longs to wed.<br>Meet to enjoy thy youthful charms,<br>O take him to thy loving arms.<br>Enamoured on his bosom lie,<br>Fair damsel of the radiant eye,<br>As the warm sunlight loves to rest<br>Upon her darling Meru’s breast.”<br><br>  The hero spoke, the monster heard,<br>While passion still her bosom stirred.<br>Away from Ráma’s side she broke,<br>And thus in turn to Lakshmaṇ spoke:<br>“Come, for thy bride take me who shine<br>In fairest grace that suits with thine.<br>Thou by my side from grove to grove<br>Of Daṇḍak’s wild in bliss shalt rove.”<br><br>  Then Lakshmaṇ, skilled in soft address,<br>Wooed by the amorous giantess,<br>With art to turn her love aside,<br>To Śúrpaṇakhá thus replied:<br><br>  “And can so high a dame agree<br>The slave-wife of a slave to be?<br>I, lotus-hued! in good and ill<br>Am bondsman to my brother’s will.<br>Be thou, fair creature radiant-eyed,<br>My honoured brother’s younger bride:<br>With faultless tint and dainty limb,<br>A happy wife, bring joy to him.<br>He from his spouse grown old and grey,<br>Deformed, untrue, will turn away,<br>Her withered charms will gladly leave,<br>And to his fair young darling cleave.<br>For who could be so fond and blind,<br>O loveliest of all female kind,<br>To love another dame and slight<br>Thy beauties rich in all delight?”<br><br>  Thus Lakshmaṇ praised in scornful jest<br>The long-toothed fiend with loathly breast,<br>Who fondly heard his speech, nor knew<br>His mocking words were aught but true.<br>Again inflamed with love she fled<br>To Ráma, in his leafy shed<br>Where Sítá rested by his side,<br>And to the mighty victor cried:<br><br>  “What, Ráma, canst thou blindly cling<br>To this old false misshapen thing?<br>Wilt thou refuse the charms of youth<br>For withered breast and grinning tooth!<br>Canst thou this wretched creature prize<br>And look on me with scornful eyes?<br>This aged crone this very hour<br>Before thy face will I devour:<br>Then joyous, from all rivals free.<br>Through Daṇḍak will I stray with thee.”<br><br>  She spoke, and with a glance of flame<br>Rushed on the fawn-eyed Maithil dame:<br>So would a horrid meteor mar<br>Fair Rohiṇí’s soft beaming star.<br>But as the furious fiend drew near,<br>Like Death’s dire noose which chills with fear,<br>The mighty chief her purpose stayed,<br>And spoke, his brother to upbraid:<br>“Ne’er should we jest with creatures rude,<br>Of savage race and wrathful mood.<br>Think, Lakshmaṇ, think how nearly slain<br>My dear Videhan breathes again.<br>Let not the hideous wretch escape<br>Without a mark to mar her shape.<br>Strike, lord of men, the monstrous fiend,<br>Deformed, and foul, and evil-miened.”<br><br>  He spoke: then Lakshmaṇ’s wrath rose high,<br>And there before his brother’s eye,<br>He drew that sword which none could stay,<br>And cleft her nose and ears away.<br>Noseless and earless, torn and maimed,<br>With fearful shrieks the fiend exclaimed,<br>And frantic in her wild distress<br>Resought the distant wilderness.<br>Deformed, terrific, huge, and dread,<br>As on she moved, her gashes bled,<br>And groan succeeded groan as loud<br>As roars, ere rain, the thunder cloud.<br>Still on the fearful monster passed,<br>While streams of blood kept falling fast,<br>And with a roar, and arms outspread<br>Within the boundless wood she fled.<br>To Janasthán the monster flew;<br>  Fierce Khara there she found,<br>With chieftains of the giant crew<br>  In thousands ranged around.<br>Before his awful feet she bent<br>  And fell with piercing cries,<br>As when a bolt in swift descent<br>  Comes flashing from the skies.<br>There for a while with senses dazed<br>  Silent she lay and scared:<br>At length her drooping head she raised,<br>  And all the tale declared,<br>How Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, and the dame<br>  Had reached that lonely place:<br>Then told her injuries and shame,<br>  And showed her bleeding face.
