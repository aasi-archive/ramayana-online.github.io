                            Thus for his wife in vain he sought:<br>Then, his sad soul with pain distraught,<br>The hero of the lotus eyes<br>Filled all the air with frantic cries.<br>O’erpowered by love’s strong influence, he<br>His absent wife still seemed to see,<br>And thus with accents weak and faint<br>Renewed with tears his wild complaint:<br><br>  “Thou, fairer than their bloom, my spouse,<br>Art hidden by Aśoka boughs.<br>Those blooms have power to banish care,<br>But now they drive me to despair.<br>Thine arms are like the plantain’s stem:<br>Why let the plantain cover them?<br>Thou art not hidden, love; thy feet<br>Betray thee in thy dark retreat.<br>Thou runnest in thy girlish sport<br>To flowery trees, thy dear resort.<br>But cease, O cease, my love, I pray,<br>To vex me with thy cruel play.<br>Such mockery in a holy spot<br>Where hermits dwell beseems thee not.<br>Ah, now I see thy fickle mind<br>To scornful mood too much inclined,<br>Come, large-eyed beauty, I implore;<br>Lone is the cot so dear before.<br><br>  No, she is slain by giants; they<br>Have stolen or devoured their prey,<br>Or surely at my mournful cry<br>My darling to her lord would fly.<br>O Lakshmaṇ, see those troops of deer:<br>In each sad eye there gleams a tear.<br>Those looks of woe too clearly say<br>My consort is the giants’ prey.<br>O noblest, fairest of the fair,<br>Where art thou, best of women, where?<br>This day will dark Kaikeyí find<br>Fresh triumph for her evil mind,<br>When I, who with my Sítá came<br>Return alone, without my dame.<br>But ne’er can I return to see<br>Those chambers where my queen should be<br>And hear the scornful people speak<br>Of Ráma as a coward weak.<br>For mine will be the coward’s shame<br>Who let the foeman steal his dame.<br>How can I seek my home, or brook<br>Upon Videha’s king to look?<br>How listen, when he bids me tell,<br>My wanderings o’er, that all is well?<br>He, when I meet his eager view,<br>Will mark that Sítá comes not too,<br>And when he hears the mournful tale<br>His wildered sense will reel and fail.<br>“O Daśaratha” will he cry,<br>“Blest in thy mansion in the sky!”<br>Ne’er to that town my steps shall bend,<br>That town which Bharat’s arms defend,<br>For e’en the blessed homes above<br>Would seem a waste without my love.<br>Leave me, my brother, here, I pray;<br>To fair Ayodhyá bend thy way.<br>Without my love I cannot bear<br>To live one hour in blank despair.<br>Round Bharat’s neck thy fond arms twine,<br>And greet him with these words of mine:<br>“Dear brother, still the power retain,<br>And o’er the land as monarch reign.”<br>With salutation next incline<br>Before thy mother, his, and mine.<br>Still, brother, to my words attend,<br>And with all care each dame befriend.<br>To my dear mother’s ear relate<br>My mournful tale and Sítá’s fate.”<br><br>  Thus Ráma gave his sorrow vent,<br>And from a heart which anguish rent,<br>Mourned for his wife in loud lament,—<br>  Her of the glorious hair,<br>From Lakshmaṇ’s cheek the colour fled,<br>And o’er his heart came sudden dread,<br>Sick, faint, and sore disquieted<br>  By woe too great to bear.
