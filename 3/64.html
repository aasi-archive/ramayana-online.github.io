                            Reft of his love, the royal chief,<br>Weighed down beneath his whelming grief,<br>Desponding made his brother share<br>His grievous burden of despair.<br>Over his sinking bosom rolled<br>The flood of sorrow uncontrolled.<br><br>  And as he wept and sighed,<br>In mournful accents faint and slow<br>With words congenial to his woe,<br><br>  To Lakshmaṇ thus he cried:<br>“Brother, I ween, beneath the sun,<br>Of all mankind there lives not one<br>So full of sin, whose hand has done<br>  Such cursed deeds as mine.<br>For my sad heart with misery bleeds,<br>As, guerdon of those evil deeds,<br>Still greater woe to woe succeeds<br>  In never-ending line.<br>A life of sin I freely chose,<br>And from my past transgression flows<br>A ceaseless flood of bitter woes<br>  My folly to repay.<br>The fruit of sin has ripened fast,<br>Through many a sorrow have I passed,<br>And now the crowning grief at last<br>  Falls on my head to-day.<br>From all my faithful friends I fled,<br>My sire is numbered with the dead,<br>My royal rank is forfeited,<br>  My mother far away.<br>These woes on which I sadly think<br>Fill, till it raves above the brink,<br>The stream of grief in which I sink,—<br>  The flood which naught can stay.<br>Ne’er, brother, ne’er have I complained;<br>Though long by toil and trouble pained,<br>Without a murmur I sustained<br>  The woes of woodland life.<br>But fiercer than the flames that rise<br>When crackling wood the food supplies,—<br>Flashing a glow through evening skies,—<br>  This sorrow for my wife.<br>Some cruel fiend has seized the prey<br>And torn my trembling love away,<br>While, as he bore her through the skies,<br>She shrieked aloud with frantic cries,<br>In tones of fear which, wild and shrill,<br>Retained their native sweetness still.<br>Ah me, that breast so soft and sweet,<br>For sandal’s precious perfume meet,<br>Now all detained with dust and gore,<br>Shall meet my fond caress no more.<br>That face, whose lips with tones so clear<br>Made pleasant music, sweet to hear,—<br>With soft locks plaited o’er the brow,—<br>Some giant’s hand is on it now.<br>It smiles not, as the dear light fails<br>When Ráhu’s jaw the moon assails.<br>Ah, my true love! that shapely neck<br>She loved with fairest chains to deck,<br>The cruel demons rend, and drain<br>The lifeblood from each mangled vein.<br>Ah, when the savage monsters came<br>And dragged away the helpless dame,<br>The lady of the long soft eye<br>Called like a lamb with piteous cry.<br>Beneath this rock, O Lakshmaṇ, see,<br>My peerless consort sat with me,<br>And gently talked to thee the while,<br>Her sweet lips opening with a smile.<br>Here is that fairest stream which she<br>Loved ever, bright Godávarí.<br>Ne’er can the dame have passed this way:<br>So far alone she would not stray,<br>Nor has my darling, lotus-eyed,<br>Sought lilies by the river’s side,<br>For without me she ne’er would go<br>To streamlets where the wild flowers grow,<br>Tell me not, brother, she has strayed<br>To the dark forest’s distant shade<br>Where blooming boughs are gay and sweet,<br>And bright birds love the cool retreat.<br>Alone my love would never dare,—<br>My timid love,—to wander there.<br><br>  O Lord of Day whose eye sees all<br>We act and plan, on thee I call:<br>For naught is hidden from thy sight,—<br>Great witness thou of wrong and right.<br>Where is she, lost or torn away?<br>Dispel my torturing doubt and say.<br>And O thou Wind who blowest free,<br>The worlds have naught concealed from thee.<br>List to my prayer, reveal one trace<br>Of her, the glory of her race.<br>Say, is she stolen hence, or dead,<br>Or do her feet the forest tread?”<br><br>  Thus with disordered senses, faint<br>With woe he poured his sad complaint,<br>And then, a better way to teach,<br>Wise Lakshmaṇ spoke in seemly speech:<br>“Up, brother dear, thy grief subdue,<br>With heart and soul thy search renew.<br>When woes oppress and dangers threat<br>Brave effort ne’er was fruitless yet.”<br><br>  He spoke, but Ráma gave no heed<br>To valiant Lakshmaṇ’s prudent rede.<br>With double force the flood of pain<br>Rushed o’er his yielding soul again.
