                            Soon as the Maithil lady knew<br>That high through air the giant flew,<br>Distressed with grief and sore afraid<br>Her troubled spirit sank dismayed.<br>Then, as anew the waters welled<br>From those red eyes which sorrow swelled,<br>Forth in keen words her passion broke,<br>And to the fierce-eyed fiend she spoke:<br>“Canst thou attempt a deed so base,<br>Untroubled by the deep disgrace,—<br>To steal me from my home and fly,<br>When friend or guardian none was nigh?<br>Thy craven soul that longed to steal,<br>Fearing the blows that warriors deal,<br>Upon a magic deer relied<br>To lure my husband from my side,<br>Friend of his sire, the vulture king<br>Lies low on earth with mangled wing,<br>Who gave his aged life for me<br>And died for her he sought to free.<br>Ah, glorious strength indeed is thine,<br>Thou meanest of thy giant line,<br>Whose courage dared to tell thy name<br>And conquer in the fight a dame.<br>Does the vile deed that thou hast done<br>Cause thee no shame, thou wicked one—<br>A woman from her home to rend<br>When none was near his aid to lend?<br>Through all the worlds, O giant King,<br>The tidings of this deed will ring,<br>This deed in law and honour’s spite<br>By one who claims a hero’s might.<br>Shame on thy boasted valour, shame!<br>Thy prowess is an empty name.<br>Shame, giant, on this cursed deed<br>For which thy race is doomed to bleed!<br>Thou fliest swifter than the gale,<br>For what can strength like thine avail?<br>Stay for one hour, O Rávaṇ, stay;<br>Thou shalt not flee with life away.<br>Soon as the royal chieftains’ sight<br>Falls on the thief who roams by night,<br>Thou wilt not, tyrant, live one hour<br>Though backed by all thy legions’ power.<br>Ne’er can thy puny strength sustain<br>The tempest of their arrowy rain:<br>Have e’er the trembling birds withstood<br>The wild flames raging in the wood?<br>Hear me, O Rávaṇ, let me go,<br>And save thy soul from coming woe.<br>Or if thou wilt not set me free,<br>Wroth for this insult done to me.<br>With his brave brother’s aid my lord<br>Against thy life will raise his sword.<br>A guilty hope inflames thy breast<br>His wife from Ráma’s home to wrest.<br>Ah fool, the hope thou hast is vain;<br>Thy dreams of bliss shall end in pain.<br>If torn from all I love by thee<br>My godlike lord no more I see,<br>Soon will I die and end my woes,<br>Nor live the captive of my foes.<br>Ah fool, with blinded eyes to choose<br>The evil and the good refuse!<br>So the sick wretch with stubborn will<br>Turns fondly to the cates that kill,<br>And madly draws his lips away<br>From medicine that would check decay.<br>About thy neck securely wound<br>The deadly coil of Fate is bound,<br>And thou, O Rávaṇ, dost not fear<br>Although the hour of death is near.<br>With death-doomed sight thine eyes behold<br>The gleaming of the trees of gold,—<br>See dread Vaitaraṇi, the flood<br>That rolls a stream of foamy blood,—<br>See the dark wood by all abhorred—<br>Its every leaf a threatening sword.<br>The tangled thickets thou shall tread<br>Where thorns with iron points are spread.<br>For never can thy days be long,<br>Base plotter of this shame and wrong<br>To Ráma of the lofty soul:<br>He dies who drinks the poisoned bowl.<br>The coils of death around thee lie:<br>They hold thee and thou canst not fly.<br>Ah whither, tyrant, wouldst thou run<br>The vengeance of my lord to shun?<br>By his unaided arm alone<br>Were twice seven thousand fiends o’erthrown:<br>Yes, in the twinkling of an eye<br>He forced thy mightiest fiends to die.<br>And shall that lord of lion heart,<br>Skilled in the bow and spear and dart,<br>Spare thee, O fiend, in battle strife,<br>The robber of his darling wife?”<br><br>  These were her words, and more beside,<br>By wrath and bitter hate supplied.<br>Then by her woe and fear o’erthrown<br>She wept again and made her moan.<br>As long she wept in grief and dread,<br>Scarce conscious of the words she said,<br>The wicked giant onward fled<br>  And bore her through the air.<br>As firm he held the Maithil dame,<br>Still wildly struggling, o’er her frame<br>With grief and bitter misery came<br>  The trembling of despair.
