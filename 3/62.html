                            When all the toil and search was vain<br>He sought his leafy home again.<br>’Twas empty still: all scattered lay<br>The seats of grass in disarray.<br>He raised his shapely arms on high<br>And spoke aloud with bitter cry:<br>“Where is the Maithil dame?” he said,<br>“O, whither has my darling fled?<br>Who can have borne away my dame,<br>Or feasted on her tender frame?<br>If, Sítá hidden by some tree,<br>Thou joyest still to mock at me,<br>Cease, cease thy cruel sport, and take<br>Compassion, or my heart will break.<br>Bethink thee, love, the gentle fawns<br>With whom thou playest on the lawns,<br>Impatient for thy coming wait<br>With streaming eyes disconsolate.<br>Reft of my love, I needs must go<br>Hence to the shades weighed down by woe.<br>The king our sire will see me there,<br>And cry, “O perjured Ráma, where,<br>Where is thy faith, that thou canst speed<br>From exile ere the time decreed?”<br><br>  Ah Sítá, whither hast thou fled<br>And left me here disquieted,<br>A hapless mourner, reft of hope,<br>Too feeble with my woe to cope?<br>E’en thus indignant Glory flies<br>The wretch who stains his soul with lies.<br>If thou, my love, art lost to view,<br>I in my woe must perish too.”<br><br>  Thus Ráma by his grief distraught<br>Wept for the wife he vainly sought,<br>And Lakshmaṇ whose fraternal breast<br>Longed for his weal, the chief addressed<br>Whose soul gave way beneath the pain<br>When all his eager search was vain,<br>Like some great elephant who stands<br>Sinking upon the treacherous sands:<br>“Not yet, O wisest chief, despair;<br>Renew thy toil with utmost care.<br>This noble hill where trees are green<br>Has many a cave and dark ravine.<br>The Maithil lady day by day<br>Delighted in the woods to stray,<br>Deep in the grove she wanders still,<br>Or walks by blossom-covered rill,<br>Or fish-loved river stealing through<br>Tall clusters of the dark bamboo.<br>Or else the dame with arch design<br>To prove thy mood, O Prince, and mine,<br>Far in some sheltering thicket lies<br>To frighten ere she meet our eyes.<br>Then come, renew thy labour, trace<br>The lady to her lurking-place,<br>And search the wood from side to side<br>To know where Sítá loves to bide.<br>Collect thy thoughts, O royal chief,<br>Nor yield to unavailing grief.”<br><br>  Thus Lakshmaṇ, by attention stirred,<br>To fresh attempts his brother spurred,<br>And Ráma, as he ceased, began<br>With Lakshmaṇ’s aid each spot to scan.<br>In eager search their way they took<br>Through wood, o’er hill, by pool and brook,<br>They roamed each mount, nor spared to seek<br>On ridge and crag and towering peak.<br>They sought the dame in every spot;<br>But all in vain; they found her not.<br>Above, below, on every side<br>They ranged the hill, and Ráma cried,<br>“O Lakshmaṇ, O my brother still<br>No trace of Sítá on the hill!”<br>Then Lakshmaṇ as he roamed the wood<br>Beside his glorious brother stood,<br>And while fierce grief his bosom burned<br>This answer to the chief returned:<br>“Thou, Ráma, after toil and pain<br>Wilt meet the Maithil dame again,<br>As Vishṇu, Bali’s might subdued,<br>His empire of the earth renewed.”<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">See Book I Canto XXXI.

</span></span><br><br>  Then Ráma cried in mournful tone,<br>His spirit by his woe o’erthrown;<br>“The wood is searched from side to side,<br>No distant spot remains untried,<br>No lilied pool, no streamlet where<br>The lotus buds are fresh and fair.<br>Our eyes have searched the hill with all<br>His caves and every waterfall,—<br>But ah, not yet I find my wife,<br>More precious than the breath of life.”<br><br>  As thus he mourned his vanished dame<br>A mighty trembling seized his frame,<br>And by o’erpowering grief assailed,<br>His troubled senses reeled and failed.<br>Too great to bear his misery grew,<br>And many a long hot sigh he drew,<br>Then as he wept and sobbed and sighed,<br>“O Sítá, O my love!” he cried.<br>Then Lakshmaṇ, joining palm to palm,<br>Tried every art his woe to calm.<br>But Ráma in his anguish heard<br>Or heeded not one soothing word,<br>Still for his spouse he mourned, and shrill<br>Rang out his lamentation still.
