                            Kabandha saw each chieftain stand<br>Imprisoned by his mighty hand,<br>Which like a snare around him pressed<br>And thus the royal pair addressed:<br>“Why, warriors, are your glances bent<br>On me whom hungry pangs torment?<br>Why stand with wildered senses? Fate<br>Has brought you now my maw to sate.”<br><br>  When Lakshmaṇ heard, a while appalled,<br>His ancient courage he recalled,<br>And to his brother by his side<br>With seasonable counsel cried:<br><br>  “This vilest of the giant race<br>Will draw us to his side apace.<br>Come, rouse thee; let the vengeful sword<br>Smite off his arms, my honoured lord.<br>This awful giant, vast of size,<br>On his huge strength of arm relies,<br>And o’er the world victorious, thus<br>With mighty force would slaughter us.<br>But in cold blood to slay, O King,<br>Discredit on the brave would bring,<br>As when some victim in the rite<br>Shuns not the hand upraised to smite.”<br><br>  The monstrous fiend, to anger stirred,<br>The converse of the brothers heard.<br>His horrid mouth he opened wide<br>And drew the princes to his side.<br>They, skilled due time and place to note<br>Unsheathed their glittering swords and smote,<br>Till from the giant’s shoulders they<br>Had hewn the mighty arms away.<br>His trenchant falchion Ráma plied<br>And smote him on the better side,<br>While valiant Lakshmaṇ on the left<br>The arm that held him prisoned cleft.<br>Then to the earth dismembered fell<br>The monster with a hideous yell,<br>And like a cloud’s his deep roar went<br>Through earth and air and firmament.<br>Then as the giant’s blood flowed fast,<br>On his cleft limbs his eye he cast,<br>And called upon the princely pair<br>Their names and lineage to declare.<br>Him then the noble Lakshmaṇ, blest<br>With fortune’s favouring marks, addressed,<br>And told the fiend his brother’s name<br>And the high blood of which he came:<br>“Ikshváku’s heir here Ráma stands,<br>Illustrious through a hundred lands.<br>I, younger brother of the heir,<br>O fiend, the name of Lakshmaṇ bear.<br>His mother stole his realm away<br>And drove him forth in woods to stray.<br>Thus through the mighty forest he<br>Roamed with his royal wife and me.<br>While glorious as a God he made<br>His dwelling in the greenwood shade,<br>Some giant stole away his dame,<br>And seeking her we hither came.<br>But tell me who thou art, and why<br>With headless trunk that towered so high,<br>With flaming face beneath thy chest,<br>Thou liest crushed in wild unrest.”<br><br>  He heard the words that Lakshmaṇ spoke,<br>And memory in his breast awoke,<br>Recalling Indra’s words to mind<br>He spoke in gentle tones and kind:<br>“O welcome best of men, are ye<br>Whom, blest by fate, this day I see.<br>A blessing on each trenchant blade<br>That low on earth these arms has laid!<br>Thou, lord of men, incline thine ear<br>The story of my woe to hear,<br>While I the rebel pride declare<br>Which doomed me to the form I wear.”
