                            Márícha thus in wild unrest<br>With bitter words the king addressed.<br>Then to his giant lord in dread,<br>“Arise, and let us go,” he said.<br>“Ah, I have met that mighty lord<br>Armed with his shafts and bow and sword,<br>And if again that bow he bend<br>Our lives that very hour will end.<br>For none that warrior can provoke<br>And think to fly his deadly stroke.<br>Like Yáma with his staff is he,<br>And his dread hand will slaughter thee.<br>What can I more? My words can find<br>No passage to thy stubborn mind.<br>I go, great King, thy task to share,<br>And may success attend thee there.”<br><br>  With that reply and bold consent<br>The giant king was well content.<br>He strained Márícha to his breast<br>And thus with joyful words addressed:<br>“There spoke a hero dauntless still,<br>Obedient to his master’s will,<br>Márícha’s proper self once more:<br>Some other took thy shape before.<br>Come, mount my jewelled car that flies.<br>Will-governed, through the yielding skies.<br>These asses, goblin-faced, shall bear<br>Us quickly through the fields of air.<br>Attract the lady with thy shape,<br>Then through the wood, at will, escape.<br>And I, when she has no defence,<br>Will seize the dame and bear her thence.”<br><br>  Again Márícha made reply,<br>Consent and will to signify.<br>With rapid speed the giants two<br>From the calm hermit dwelling flew,<br>Borne in that wondrous chariot, meet<br>For some great God’s celestial seat.<br>They from their airy path looked down<br>On many a wood and many a town,<br>On lake and river, brook and rill,<br>City and realm and towering hill.<br>Soon he whom giant hosts obeyed,<br>Márícha by his side, surveyed<br>The dark expanse of Daṇḍak wood<br>Where Ráma’s hermit cottage stood.<br>They left the flying car, whereon<br>The wealth of gold and jewels shone,<br>And thus the giant king addressed<br>Márícha as his hand he pressed:<br><br>  “Márícha, look! before our eyes<br>Round Ráma’s home the plantains rise.<br>His hermitage is now in view:<br>Quick to the work we came to do!”<br><br>  Thus Rávaṇ spoke, Márícha heard<br>Obedient to his master’s word,<br>Threw off his giant shape and near<br>The cottage strayed a beauteous deer.<br>With magic power, by rapid change,<br>His borrowed form was fair and strange.<br>A sapphire tipped each horn with light;<br>His face was black relieved with white.<br>The turkis and the ruby shed<br>A glory from his ears and head.<br>His arching neck was proudly raised,<br>And lazulites beneath it blazed.<br>With roseate bloom his flanks were dyed,<br>And lotus tints adorned his hide.<br>His shape was fair, compact, and slight;<br>His hoofs were carven lazulite.<br>His tail with every changing glow<br>Displayed the hues of Indra’s bow.<br>With glossy skin so strangely flecked,<br>With tints of every gem bedecked.<br>A light o’er Ráma’s home he sent,<br>And through the wood, where’er he went.<br>The giant clad in that strange dress<br>That took the soul with loveliness,<br>To charm the fair Videhan’s eyes<br>With mingled wealth of mineral dyes,<br>Moved onward, cropping in his way,<br>The grass and grain and tender spray.<br>His coat with drops of silver bright,<br>A form to gaze on with delight,<br>He raised his fair neck as he went<br>To browse on bud and filament.<br>Now in the Cassia grove he strayed,<br>Now by the cot in plantains’ shade.<br>Slowly and slowly on he came<br>To catch the glances of the dame,<br>And the tall deer of splendid hue<br>Shone full at length in Sítá’s view.<br>He roamed where’er his fancy chose<br>Where Ráma’s leafy cottage rose.<br>Now near, now far, in careless ease,<br>He came and went among the trees.<br>Now with light feet he turned to fly,<br>Now, reassured, again drew nigh:<br>Now gambolled close with leap and bound,<br>Now lay upon the grassy ground:<br>Now sought the door, devoid of fear,<br>And mingled with the troop of deer;<br>Led them a little way, and thence<br>Again returned with confidence.<br>Now flying far, now turning back<br>Emboldened on his former track,<br>Seeking to win the lady’s glance<br>He wandered through the green expanse.<br>Then thronging round, the woodland deer<br>Gazed on his form with wondering fear;<br>A while they followed where he led,<br>Then snuffed the tainted gale and fled.<br>The giant, though he longed to slay<br>The startled quarry, spared the prey,<br>And mindful of the shape he wore<br>To veil his nature, still forbore.<br>Then Sítá of the glorious eye,<br>Returning from her task drew nigh;<br>For she had sought the wood to bring<br>Each loveliest flower of early spring.<br>Now would the bright-eyed lady choose<br>Some gorgeous bud with blending hues,<br>Now plucked the mango’s spray, and now<br>The bloom from an Aśoka bough.<br>She with her beauteous form, unmeet<br>For woodland life and lone retreat,<br>That wondrous dappled deer beheld<br>Gemmed with rich pearls, unparalleled,<br>His silver hair the lady saw,<br>His radiant teeth and lips and jaw,<br>And gazed with rapture as her eyes<br>Expanded in their glad surprise.<br>And when the false deer’s glances fell<br>On her whom Ráma loved so well,<br>He wandered here and there, and cast<br>A luminous beauty as he passed;<br>And Janak’s child with strange delight<br>Kept gazing on the unwonted sight.
