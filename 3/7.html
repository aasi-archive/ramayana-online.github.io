With pious care<br>He turned him to his evening prayer,<br>Performed each customary rite,<br>And sought his lodging for the night,<br>With Sítá and his brother laid<br>Beneath the grove’s delightful shade,<br>First good Sutíkshṇa, as elsewhere, when he saw<br>The shades of night around them draw,<br>  With hospitable care<br>The princely chieftains entertained<br>With store of choicest food ordained<br>  For holy hermit’s fare.
