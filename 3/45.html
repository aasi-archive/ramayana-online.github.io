                            But Sítá hearing as she thought,<br>Her husband’s cry with anguish fraught,<br>Called to her guardian, “Lakshmaṇ, run<br>And in the wood seek Raghu’s son.<br>Scarce can my heart retain its throne,<br>Scarce can my life be called mine own,<br>As all my powers and senses fail<br>At that long, loud and bitter wail.<br>Haste to the wood with all thy speed<br>And save thy brother in his need.<br>Go, save him in the distant glade<br>Where loud he calls, for timely aid.<br>He falls beneath some giant foe—<br>A bull whom lions overthrow.”<br><br>  Deaf to her prayer, no step he stirred<br>Obedient to his mother’s word,<br>Then Janak’s child, with ire inflamed,<br>In words of bitter scorn exclaimed exclaimed<br><br>  “Sumitrá’s son, a friend in show,<br>Thou art in truth thy brother’s foe,<br>Who canst at such any hour deny<br>Thy succour and neglect his cry.<br>Yes, Lakshmaṇ, smit with love of me<br>Thy brother’s death thou fain wouldst see.<br>This guilty love thy heart has swayed<br>And makes thy feet so loth to aid.<br>Thou hast no love for Ráma, no:<br>Thy joy is vice, thy thoughts are low<br>Hence thus unmoved thou yet canst stay<br>While my dear lord is far away.<br>If aught of ill my lord betide<br>Who led thee here, thy chief and guide,<br>Ah, what will be my hapless fate<br>Left in the wild wood desolate!”<br><br>  Thus spoke the lady sad with fear,<br>With many a sigh and many a tear,<br>Still trembling like a captured doe:<br>And Lakshmaṇ spoke to calm her woe:<br><br>  “Videhan Queen, be sure of this,—<br>And at the thought thy fear dismiss,—<br>Thy husband’s mightier power defies<br>All Gods and angels of the skies,<br>Gandharvas, and the sons of light,<br>Serpents, and rovers of the night.<br>I tell thee, of the sons of earth,<br>Of Gods who boast celestial birth,<br>Of beasts and birds and giant hosts,<br>Of demigods, Gandharvas, ghosts,<br>Of awful fiends, O thou most fair,<br>There lives not one whose heart would dare<br>To meet thy Ráma in the fight,<br>Like Indra’s self unmatched in might.<br>Such idle words thou must not say<br>Thy Ráma lives whom none may slay.<br>I will not, cannot leave thee here<br>In the wild wood till he be near.<br>The mightiest strength can ne’er withstand<br>His eager force, his vigorous hand.<br>No, not the triple world allied<br>With all the immortal Gods beside.<br>Dismiss thy fear, again take heart,<br>Let all thy doubt and woe depart.<br>Thy lord, be sure, will soon be here<br>And bring thee back that best of deer.<br>Not his, not his that mournful cry,<br>Nor haply came it from the sky.<br>Some giant’s art was busy there<br>And framed a castle based on air.<br>A precious pledge art thou, consigned<br>To me by him of noblest mind,<br>Nor can I fairest dame, forsake<br>The pledge which Ráma bade me take.<br>Upon our heads, O Queen, we drew<br>The giants’ hate when Ráma slew<br>Their chieftain Khara, and the shade<br>Of Janasthán in ruin laid.<br>Through all this mighty wood they rove<br>With varied cries from grove to grove<br>On rapine bent they wander here:<br>But O, dismiss thy causeless fear.”<br><br>  Bright flashed her eye as Lakshmaṇ spoke<br>And forth her words of fury broke<br>Upon her truthful guardian, flung<br>With bitter taunts that pierced and stung:<br>“Shame on such false compassion, base<br>Defiler of thy glorious race!<br>’Twere joyous sight I ween to thee<br>My lord in direst strait to see.<br>Thou knowest Ráma sore bested,<br>Or word like this thou ne’er hadst said.<br>No marvel if we find such sin<br>In rivals false to kith and kin.<br>Wretches like thee of evil kind,<br>Concealing crime with crafty mind.<br>Thou, wretch, thine aid wilt still deny,<br>And leave my lord alone to die.<br>Has love of me unnerved thy hand,<br>Or Bharat’s art this ruin planned?<br>But be the treachery his or thine,<br>In vain, in vain the base design.<br>For how shall I, the chosen bride<br>Of dark-hued Ráma, lotus-eyed,<br>The queen who once called Ráma mine,<br>To love of other men decline?<br>Believe me, Lakshmaṇ, Ráma’s wife<br>Before thine eyes will quit this life,<br>And not a moment will she stay<br>If her dear lord have passed away.”<br><br>  The lady’s bitter speech, that stirred<br>Each hair upon his frame, he heard.<br>With lifted hands together laid,<br>His calm reply he gently made:<br><br>  “No words have I to answer now:<br>My deity, O Queen, art thou.<br>But ’tis no marvel, dame, to find<br>Such lack of sense in womankind.<br>Throughout this world, O Maithil dame,<br>Weak women’s hearts are still the same.<br>Inconstant, urged by envious spite,<br>They sever friends and hate the right.<br>I cannot brook, Videhan Queen,<br>Thy words intolerably keen.<br>Mine ears thy fierce reproaches pain<br>As boiling water seethes the brain.<br>And now to bear me witness all<br>The dwellers in the wood I call,<br>That, when with words of truth I plead,<br>This harsh reply is all my meed.<br>Ah, woe is thee! Ah, grief, that still<br>Eager to do my brother’s will,<br>Mourning thy woman’s nature, I<br>Must see thee doubt my truth and die.<br>I fly to Ráma’s side, and Oh,<br>May bliss attend thee while I go!<br>May all attendant wood-gods screen<br>Thy head from harm, O large-eyed Queen!<br>And though dire omens meet my sight<br>And fill my soul with wild affright,<br>May I return in peace and see<br>The son of Raghu safe with thee!”<br><br>  The child of Janak heard him speak,<br>And the hot tear-drops down her cheek,<br>Increasing to a torrent, ran,<br>As thus once more the dame began:<br>“O Lakshmaṇ, if I widowed be<br>Godávarí’s flood shall cover me,<br>Or I will die by cord, or leap,<br>Life weary, from yon rocky steep;<br>Or deadly poison will I drink,<br>Or ’neath the kindled flames will sink,<br>But never, reft of Ráma, can<br>Consent to touch a meaner man.”<br><br>  The Maithil dame with many sighs,<br>And torrents pouring from her eyes,<br>The faithful Lakshmaṇ thus addressed,<br>And smote her hands upon her breast.<br>  >Sumitrá’s son, o’erwhelmed by fears,<br>    Looked on the large-eyed queen:<br>  He saw that flood of burning tears,<br>    He saw that piteous mien.<br>  He yearned sweet comfort to afford,<br>    He strove to soothe her pain;<br>  But to the brother of her lord<br>    She spoke no word again.<br>  His reverent hands once more he raised,<br>    His head he slightly bent,<br>  Upon her face he sadly gazed,<br>    And then toward Ráma went.
