                            Fierce Śúrpaṇakhá with her train<br>To Ráma’s dwelling came again,<br>And to the eager giants showed<br>Where Sítá and the youths abode.<br>Within the leafy cot they spied<br>The hero by his consort’s side,<br>And faithful Lakshmaṇ ready still<br>To wait upon his brother’s will.<br>Then noble Ráma raised his eye<br>And saw the giants standing nigh,<br>And then, as nearer still they pressed.<br>His glorious brother thus addressed,<br>“Be thine a while, my brother dear,<br>To watch o’er Sítá’s safety here,<br>And I will slay these creatures who<br>The footsteps of my spouse pursue.”<br><br>  He spoke, and reverent Lakshmaṇ heard<br>Submissive to his brother’s word.<br>The son of Raghu, virtuous-souled,<br>Strung his great bow adorned with gold,<br>And, with the weapon in his hand,<br>Addressed him to the giant band:<br>“Ráma and Lakshmaṇ we, who spring<br>From Daśaratha, mighty king;<br>We dwell a while with Sítá here<br>In Daṇḍak forest wild and drear.<br>On woodland roots and fruit we feed,<br>And lives of strictest rule we lead.<br>Say why would ye our lives oppress<br>Who sojourn in the wilderness.<br>Sent hither by the hermits’ prayer<br>With bow and darts unused to spare,<br>For vengeance am I come to slay<br>Your sinful band in battle fray.<br>Rest as ye are: remain content,<br>Nor try the battle’s dire event.<br>Unless your offered lives ye spurn,<br>O rovers of the night, return.”<br><br>  They listened while the hero spoke,<br>And fury in each breast awoke.<br>The Bráhman-slayers raised on high<br>Their mighty spears and made reply:<br>They spoke with eyes aglow with ire,<br>While Ráma’s burnt with vengeful tire,<br>And answered thus, in fury wild,<br>That peerless chief whose tones were mild:<br><br>  “Nay thou hast angered, overbold,<br>Khara our lord, the mighty-souled,<br>And for thy sin, in battle strife<br>Shalt yield to us thy forfeit life.<br>No power hast thou alone to stand<br>Against the numbers of our band.<br>’Twere vain to match thy single might<br>Against us in the front of fight.<br>When we equipped for fight advance<br>With brandished pike and mace and lance,<br>Thou, vanquished in the desperate field,<br>Thy bow, thy strength, thy life shalt yield.”<br><br>  With bitter words and threatening mien<br>Thus furious spoke the fierce fourteen,<br>And raising scimitar and spear<br>On Ráma rushed in wild career.<br>Their levelled spears the giant crew<br>Against the matchless hero threw.<br>His bow the son of Raghu bent,<br>And twice seven shafts to meet them sent,<br>And every javelin sundered fell<br>By the bright darts he aimed so well.<br><br>  The hero saw: his anger grew<br>To fury: from his side he drew<br>Fresh sunbright arrows pointed keen,<br>In number, like his foes, fourteen.<br>His bow he grasped, the string he drew,<br>And gazing on the giant crew,<br>As Indra casts the levin, so<br>Shot forth his arrows at the foe.<br>The hurtling arrows, stained with gore,<br>Through the fiends’ breasts a passage tore,<br>And in the earth lay buried deep<br>As serpents through an ant-hill creep<br>Like trees uptorn by stormy blast<br>The shattered fiends to earth were cast,<br>And there with mangled bodies they,<br>Bathed in their blood and breathless, lay.<br><br>  With fainting heart and furious eye<br>The demon saw her champions die.<br>With drying wounds that scarcely bled<br>Back to her brother’s home she fled.<br>Oppressed with pain, with loud lament<br>At Khara’s feet the monster bent.<br>There like a plant whence slowly come<br>The trickling drops of oozy gum,<br>With her grim features pale with pain<br>She poured her tears in ceaseless rain,<br>There routed Śúrpaṇakhá lay,<br>  And told her brother all,<br>The issue of the bloody fray,<br>  Her giant champions’ fall.
