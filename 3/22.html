                            Roused by the taunting words she spoke,<br>The mighty Khara’s wrath awoke,<br>And there, while giants girt him round,<br>In these fierce words an utterance found:<br><br>  “I cannot, peerless one, contain<br>Mine anger at this high disdain,<br>Galling as salt when sprinkled o’er<br>The rawness of a bleeding sore.<br>Ráma in little count I hold,<br>Weak man whose days are quickly told.<br>The caitiff with his life to-day<br>For all his evil deeds shall pay.<br>Dry, sister, dry each needless tear,<br>Stint thy lament and banish fear,<br>For Ráma and his brother go<br>This day to Yáma’s realm below.<br>My warrior’s axe shall stretch him slain,<br>Ere set of sun, upon the plain,<br>Then shall thy sated lips be red<br>With his warm blood in torrents shed.”<br><br>  As Khara’s speech the demon heard,<br>With sudden joy her heart was stirred:<br>She fondly praised him as the boast<br>And glory of the giant host.<br>First moved to ire by taunts and stings,<br>Now soothed by gentle flatterings,<br>To Dúshaṇ, who his armies led,<br>The demon Khara spoke, and said:<br><br>  “Friend, from the host of giants call<br>Full fourteen thousand, best of all,<br>Slaves of my will, of fearful might,<br>Who never turn their backs in fight:<br>Fiends who rejoice to slay and mar,<br>Dark as the clouds of autumn are:<br>Make ready quickly, O my friend,<br>My chariot and the bows I bend.<br>My swords, my shafts of brilliant sheen,<br>My divers lances long and keen.<br>On to the battle will I lead<br>These heroes of Pulastya’s seed,<br>And thus, O famed for warlike skill,<br>Ráma my wicked foeman kill.”<br><br>  He spoke, and ere his speech was done,<br>His chariot glittering like the sun,<br>Yoked and announced, by Dúshan’s care,<br>With dappled steeds was ready there.<br>High as a peak from Meru rent<br>It burned with golden ornament:<br>The pole of lazulite, of gold<br>Were the bright wheels whereon it rolled.<br>With gold and moonstone blazoned o’er,<br>Fish, flowers, trees, rocks, the panels bore;<br>Auspicious birds embossed thereon,<br>And stars in costly emblem shone.<br>O’er flashing swords his banner hung,<br>And sweet bells, ever tinkling, swung.<br>That mighty host with sword and shield<br>And oar was ready for the field:<br>And Khara saw, and Dúshan cried,<br>“Forth to the fight, ye giants, ride.”<br>Then banners waved, and shield and sword<br>Flashed as the host obeyed its lord.<br>From Janasthán they sallied out<br>With eager speed, and din, and shout,<br>Armed with the mace for close attacks,<br>The bill, the spear, the battle-axe,<br>Steel quoit and club that flashed afar,<br>Huge bow and sword and scimitar,<br>The dart to pierce, the bolt to strike,<br>The murderous bludgeon, lance, and pike.<br>So forth from Janasthán, intent<br>On Khara’s will, the monsters went.<br>He saw their awful march: not far<br>Behind the host he drove his car.<br>Ware of his master’s will, to speed<br>The driver urged each gold-decked steed.<br>Then forth the warrior’s coursers sprang,<br>And with tumultuous murmur rang<br>Each distant quarter of the sky<br>And realms that intermediate lie.<br>High and more high within his breast<br>  His pride triumphant rose,<br>While terrible as Death he pressed<br>  Onward to slay his foes,<br>“More swiftly yet,” as on they fled,<br>  He cried in thundering tones<br>Loud as a cloud that overhead<br>  Hails down a flood of stones.
