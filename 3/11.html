pool,<br>While swan, and crane, and mallard’s wings<br>Are lovely in the water-springs.<br>There for one night, O Ráma, stay,<br>And with the dawn pursue thy way.<br>Still farther, bending southward, by<br>The thicket’s edge the course must lie,<br>And thou wilt see, two leagues from thence<br>Agastya’s lovely residence,<br>Set in the woodland’s fairest spot,<br>All varied foliage decks the cot:<br>There Sítá, Lakshmaṇ thou, at ease<br>May spend sweet hours neath shady trees,<br>For all of noblest growth are found<br>Luxuriant on that bosky ground.<br>If it be still thy firm intent<br>To see that saint preëminent,<br>O mighty counsellor, this day<br>Depart upon thine onward way.”<br><br>  The hermit spake, and Ráma bent<br>His head, with Lakshmaṇ, reverent,<br>And then with him and Janak’s child<br>Set out to trace the forest wild.<br>He saw dark woods that fringed the road,<br>And distant hills like clouds that showed,<br>And, as the way he followed, met<br>With many a lake and rivulet.<br>So passing on with ease where led<br>The path Sutíkshṇa bade him tread,<br>The hero with exulting breast<br>His brother in these words addressed:<br><br>  “Here, surely, is the home, in sight,<br>Of that illustrious anchorite:<br>Here great Agastya’s brother leads<br>A life intent on holy deeds.<br>Warned of each guiding mark and sign,<br>I see them all herein combine:<br>I see the branches bending low<br>Beneath the flowers and fruit they show.<br>A soft air from the forest springs,<br>Fresh from the odorous grass, and brings<br>A spicy fragrance as it flees<br>O’er the ripe fruit of Pippal trees.<br>See, here and there around us high<br>Piled up in heaps cleft billets lie,<br>And holy grass is gathered, bright<br>As strips of shining lazulite.<br>Full in the centre of the shade<br>The hermits’ holy fire is laid:<br>I see its smoke the pure heaven streak<br>Dense as a big cloud’s dusky peak.<br>The twice-born men their steps retrace<br>From each sequestered bathing-place,<br>And each his sacred gift has brought<br>Of blossoms which his hands have sought.<br>Of all these signs, dear brother, each<br>Agrees with good Sutíkshṇa’s speech,<br>And doubtless in this holy bound<br>Agastya’s brother will be found.<br>Agastya once, the worlds who viewed<br>With love, a Deathlike fiend subdued,<br>And armed with mighty power, obtained<br>By holy works, this grove ordained<br>To be a refuge and defence<br>From all oppressors’ violence.<br>In days of yore within this place<br>Two brothers fierce of demon race,<br>Vátápi dire and Ilval, dwelt,<br>And slaughter mid the Bráhmans dealt.<br>A Bráhman’s form, the fiend to cloak,<br>Fierce Ilval wore, and Sanskrit spoke,<br>And twice-born sages would invite<br>To solemnize some funeral rite.<br>His brother’s flesh, concealed within<br>A ram’s false shape and borrowed skin,—<br>As men are wont at funeral feasts,—<br>He dressed and fed those gathered priests.<br>The holy men, unweeting ill,<br>Took of the food and ate their fill.<br>Then Ilval with a mighty shout<br>Exclaimed “Vátápi, issue out.”<br>Soon as his brother’s voice he heard,<br>The fiend with ram-like bleating stirred:<br>Rending in pieces every frame,<br>Forth from the dying priests he came.<br>So they who changed their forms at will<br>Thousands of Bráhmans dared to kill,—<br>Fierce fiends who loved each cruel deed,<br>And joyed on bleeding flesh to feed.<br>Agastya, mighty hermit, pressed<br>To funeral banquet like the rest,<br>Obedient to the Gods’ appeal<br>Ate up the monster at a meal.<br>“’Tis done, ’tis done,” fierce Ilval cried,<br>And water for his hands supplied:<br>Then lifting up his voice he spake:<br>“Forth, brother, from thy prison break.”<br>Then him who called the fiend, who long<br>Had wrought the suffering Bráhmans wrong,<br>Thus thoughtful-souled Agastya, best<br>Of hermits, with a smile addressed:<br>“How, Rákshas, is the fiend empowered<br>To issue forth whom I devoured?<br>Thy brother in a ram’s disguise<br>Is gone where Yáma’s kingdom lies.”<br>When from the words Agastya said<br>He knew his brother fiend was dead,<br>His soul on fire with vengeful rage,<br>Rushed the night-rover at the sage.<br>One lightning glance of fury, hot<br>As fire, the glorious hermit shot,<br>As the fiend neared him in his stride,<br>And straight, consumed to dust, he died.<br>In pity for the Bráhmans’ plight<br>Agastya wrought this deed of might:<br>This grove which lakes and fair trees grace<br>In his great brother’s dwelling place.”<br><br>  As Ráma thus the tale rehearsed,<br>And with Sumitrá’s son conversed,<br>The setting sun his last rays shed,<br>And evening o’er the land was spread.<br>A while the princely brothers stayed<br>And even rites in order paid,<br>Then to the holy grove they drew<br>And hailed the saint with honour due.<br>With courtesy was Ráma met<br>By that illustrious anchoret,<br>And for one night he rested there<br>Regaled with fruit and hermit fare.<br>But when the night had reached its close,<br>And the sun’s glorious circle rose,<br>The son of Raghu left his bed<br>And to the hermit’s brother said:<br>“Well rested in thy hermit cell,<br>I stand, O saint, to bid farewell;<br>For with thy leave I journey hence<br>Thy brother saint to reverence.”<br>“Go, Ráma go,” the sage replied:<br>Then from the cot the chieftain hied.<br>And while the pleasant grove he viewed,<br>The path the hermit showed, pursued.<br>Of every leaf, of changing hue.<br>Plants, trees by hundreds round him grew,<br>With joyous eyes he looked on all,<br>Then Jak,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The bread-fruit tree, Artocarpus integrifolia.
