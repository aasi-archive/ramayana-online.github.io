                            When Ráma saw the giant nigh,<br>On foot, alone, with mace reared high,<br>In mild reproof at first he spoke,<br>Then forth his threatening anger broke:<br>“Thou with the host ’twas thine to lead,<br>With elephant and car and steed,<br>Hast wrought an act of sin and shame,<br>An act which all who live must blame.<br>Know that the wretch whose evil mind<br>Joys in the grief of human kind,<br>Though the three worlds confess him lord,<br>Must perish dreaded and abhorred.<br>Night-rover, when a villain’s deeds<br>Distress the world he little heeds,<br>Each hand is armed his life to take,<br>And crush him like a deadly snake.<br>The end is near when men begin<br>Through greed or lust a life of sin,<br>E’en as a Bráhman’s dame, unwise,<br>Eats of the fallen hail<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Popularly supposed to cause death.

Much more remains<br>That should be said: but time constrains.<br>Ere to his rest the sun descend,<br>And shades of night the combat end,<br>The twice seven thousand of my band<br>Who fell beneath thy bloody hand<br>Shall have their tears all wiped away<br>And triumph in thy fall to-day.”<br><br>  He spoke, and loosing from his hold<br>His mighty mace ringed round with gold,<br>Like some red bolt alive with fire<br>Hurled it at Ráma, mad with ire.<br>The ponderous mace which Khara threw<br>Sent fiery flashes as it flew.<br>Trees, shrubs were scorched beneath the blast,<br>As onward to its aim it passed.<br>But Ráma, watching as it sped<br>Dire as His noose who rules the dead,<br>Cleft it with arrows as it came<br>On rushing with a hiss and flame.<br>Its fury spent and burnt away,<br>Harmless upon the ground it lay<br>Like a great snake in furious mood<br>By herbs of numbing power subdued.
