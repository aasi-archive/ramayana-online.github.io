                            Virádha with a fearful shout<br>That echoed through the wood, cried out:<br><br>  “What men are ye, I bid you say,<br>And whither would ye bend your way?”<br><br>  To him whose mouth shot fiery flame<br>The hero told his race and name:<br>“Two Warriors, nobly bred, are we,<br>And through this wood we wander free.<br>But who art thou, how born and styled,<br>Who roamest here in Daṇḍak’s wild?”<br><br>  To Ráma, bravest of the brave,<br>His answer thus Virádha gave:<br>“Hear, Raghu’s son, and mark me well,<br>And I my name and race will tell.<br>Of Śatahradá born, I spring<br>From Java as my sire, O King:<br>Me, of this lofty lineage, all<br>Giants on earth Virádha call.<br>The rites austere I long maintained<br>From Brahmá’s grace the boon have gained<br>To bear a charmed frame which ne’er<br>Weapon or shaft may pierce or tear.<br>Go as ye came, untouched by fear,<br>And leave with me this woman here:<br>Go, swiftly from my presence fly,<br>Or by this hand ye both shall die.”<br><br>  Then Ráma with his fierce eyes red<br>With fury to the giant said:<br>“Woe to thee, sinner, fond and weak,<br>Who madly thus thy death wilt seek!<br>Stand, for it waits thee in the fray:<br>With life thou ne’er shalt flee away.”<br><br>  He spoke, and raised the cord whereon<br>A pointed arrow flashed and shone,<br>Then, wild with anger, from his bow,<br>He launched the weapon on the foe.<br>Seven times the fatal cord he drew,<br>And forth seven rapid arrows flew,<br>Shafts winged with gold that left the wind<br>And e’en Suparṇa’s<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The king of birds.
