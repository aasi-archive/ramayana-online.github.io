                            Soon as the fiend had set her down<br>Within his home in Lanká’s town<br>Triumph and joy filled Indra’s breast,<br>Whom thus the Eternal Sire addressed:<br><br>  “This deed will free the worlds from woe<br>And cause the giants’ overthrow.<br>The fiend has borne to Lanká’s isle<br>The lady of the lovely smile,<br>True consort born to happy fate<br>With features fair and delicate.<br>She looks and longs for Ráma’s face,<br>But sees a crowd of demon race,<br>And guarded by the giant’s train<br>Pines for her lord and weeps in vain.<br>But Lanká founded on a steep<br>Is girdled by the mighty deep,<br>And how will Ráma know his fair<br>And blameless wife is prisoned there?<br>She on her woe will sadly brood<br>And pine away in solitude,<br>And heedless of herself, will cease<br>To live, despairing of release.<br>Yes, pondering on her fate, I see<br>Her gentle life in jeopardy.<br>Go, Indra, swiftly seek the place,<br>And look upon her lovely face.<br>Within the city make thy way:<br>Let heavenly food her spirit stay.”<br><br>  Thus Brahma spake: and He who slew<br>The cruel demon Páka, flew<br>Where Lanká’s royal city lay,<br>And Sleep went with him on his way.<br>“Sleep,” cried the heavenly Monarch, “close<br>Each giant’s eye in deep repose.”<br><br>  Thus Indra spoke, and Sleep fulfilled<br>With joy his mandate, as he willed,<br>To aid the plan the Gods proposed,<br>The demons’ eyes in sleep she closed.<br>Then Śachí’s lord, the Thousand-eyed,<br>To the Aśoka garden hied.<br>He came and stood where Sítá lay,<br>And gently thus began to say:<br>“Lord of the Gods who hold the sky,<br>Dame of the lovely smile, am I.<br>Weep no more, lady, weep no more;<br>Thy days of woe will soon be o’er.<br>I come, O Janak’s child, to be<br>The helper of thy lord and thee.<br>He through my grace, with hosts to aid,<br>This sea-girt land will soon invade.<br>’Tis by my art that slumbers close<br>The eyelids of thy giant foes.<br>Now I, with Sleep, this place have sought,<br>Videhan lady, and have brought<br>A gift of heaven’s ambrosial food<br>To stay thee in thy solitude.<br>Receive it from my hand, and taste,<br>O lady of the dainty waist:<br>For countless ages thou shall be<br>From pangs of thirst and hunger free.”<br><br>  But doubt within her bosom woke<br>As to the Lord of Gods she spoke:<br>“How may I know for truth that thou<br>Whose form I see before me now<br>Art verily the King adored<br>By heavenly Gods, and Śachí’s lord?<br>With Raghu’s sons I learnt to know<br>The certain signs which Godhead show.<br>These marks before mine eyes display<br>If o’er the Gods thou bear the sway.”<br><br>  The heavenly lord of Śachí heard,<br>And did according to her word.<br>Above the ground his feet were raised;<br>With eyelids motionless he gazed.<br>No dust upon his raiment lay,<br>And his bright wreath was fresh and gay.<br>Nor was the lady’s glad heart slow<br>The Monarch of the Gods to know,<br>And while the tears unceasing ran<br>From her sweet eyes she thus began:<br>“My lord has gained a friend in thee,<br>And I this day thy presence see<br>Shown clearly to mine eyes, as when<br>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ, lords of men,<br>Beheld it, and their sire the king,<br>And Janak too from whom I spring.<br>Now I, O Monarch of the Blest,<br>Will eat this food at thy behest,<br>Which thou hast brought me, of thy grace,<br>To aid and strengthen Raghu’s race.”<br><br>  She spoke, and by his words relieved,<br>The food from Indra’s hand received,<br>Yet ere she ate the balm he brought,<br>On Lakshmaṇ and her lord she thought.<br>“If my brave lord be still alive,<br>If valiant Lakshmaṇ yet survive,<br>May this my taste of heavenly food<br>Bring health to them and bliss renewed!”<br>    She ate, and that celestial food<br>  Stayed hunger, thirst, and lassitude,<br>    And all her strength restored.<br>  Great joy her hopeful spirit stirred<br>  At the glad tidings newly heard<br>    Of Lakshmaṇ and her lord.<br>  And Indra’s heart was joyful too:<br>  He bade the Maithil dame adieu,<br>    His saving errand done.<br>  With Sleep beside him parting thence<br>  He sought his heavenly residence<br>    To prosper Raghu’s son.
