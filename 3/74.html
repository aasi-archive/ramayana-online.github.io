                            When wise Kabandha thus had taught<br>The means to find the dame they sought,<br>And urged them onward in the quest,<br>He thus again the prince addressed:<br><br>  “This path, O Raghu’s son, pursue<br>Where those fair trees which charm the view,<br>Extending westward far away,<br>The glory of their bloom display,<br>Where their bright leaves Rose-apples show,<br>And the tall Jak and Mango grow.<br>Whene’er you will, those trees ascend,<br>Or the long branches shake and bend,<br>Their savoury fruit like Amrit eat,<br>Then onward speed with willing feet.<br>Beyond this shady forest, decked<br>With flowering trees, your course direct.<br>Another grove you then will find<br>With every joy to take the mind,<br>Like Nandan with its charms displayed,<br>Or Northern Kuru’s blissful shade;<br>Where trees distil their balmy juice,<br>And fruit through all the year produce;<br>Where shades with seasons ever fair<br>With Chaitraratha may compare:<br>Where trees whose sprays with fruit are bowed<br>Rise like a mountain or a cloud.<br>There, when you list, from time to time,<br>The loaded trees may Lakshmaṇ climb,<br>Or from the shaken boughs supply<br>Sweet fruit that may with Amrit vie.<br>The onward path pursuing still<br>From wood to wood, from hill to hill,<br>Your happy eyes at length will rest<br>On Pampá’s lotus-covered breast.<br>Her banks with gentle slope descend,<br>Nor stones nor weed the eyes offend,<br>And o’er smooth beds of silver sand<br>Lotus and lily blooms expand.<br>There swans and ducks and curlews play,<br>And keen-eyed ospreys watch their prey,<br>And from the limpid waves are heard<br>Glad notes of many a water-bird.<br>Untaught a deadly foe to fear<br>They fly not when a man is near,<br>And fat as balls of butter they<br>Will, when you list, your hunger stay.<br>Then Lakshmaṇ with his shafts will take<br>The fish that swim the brook and lake,<br>Remove each bone and scale and fin,<br>Or strip away the speckled skin,<br>And then on iron skewers broil<br>For thy repast the savoury spoil.<br>Thou on a heap of flowers shalt rest<br>And eat the meal his hands have dressed,<br>There shalt thou lie on Pampá’s brink,<br>And Lakshmaṇ’s hand shall give thee drink,<br>Filling a lotus leaf with cool<br>Pure water from the crystal pool,<br>To which the opening blooms have lent<br>The riches of divinest scent.<br>Beside thee at the close of day<br>Will Lakshmaṇ through the woodland stray,<br>And show thee where the monkeys sleep<br>In caves beneath the mountain steep.<br>Loud-voiced as bulls they forth will burst<br>And seek the flood, oppressed by thirst;<br>Then rest a while, their wants supplied,<br>Their well-fed bands on Pampá’s side.<br>Thou roving there at eve shalt see<br>Rich clusters hang on shrub and tree,<br>And Pampá flushed with roseate glow,<br>And at the view forget thy woe.<br>There shalt thou mark with strange delight<br>Each loveliest flower that blooms by night,<br>While lily buds that shrink from day<br>Their tender loveliness display.<br>In that far wild no hand but thine<br>Those peerless flowers in wreaths shall twine:<br>Immortal in their changeless pride,<br>Ne’er fade those blooms and ne’er are dried.<br>There erst on holy thoughts intent<br>Their days Matanga’s pupils spent.<br>Once for their master food they sought,<br>And store of fruit and berries brought.<br>Then as they laboured through the dell<br>From limb and brow the heat-drops fell:<br>Thence sprang and bloomed those wondrous trees:<br>Such holy power have devotees.<br>Thus, from the hermits’ heat-drops sprung,<br>Their growth is ever fresh and young.<br>There Śavarí is dwelling yet,<br>Who served each vanished anchoret.<br>Beneath the shade of holy boughs<br>That ancient votaress keeps her vows.<br>Her happy eyes on thee will fall,<br>O godlike prince, adored by all,<br>And she, whose life is pure from sin,<br>A blissful seat in heaven will win.<br>But cross, O son of Raghu, o’er,<br>And stand on Pampá’s western shore.<br>A tranquil hermitage that lies<br>Deep in the woods will meet thine eyes.<br>No wandering elephants invade<br>The stillness of that holy shade,<br>But checked by saint Matanga’s power<br>They spare each consecrated bower.<br>Through many an age those trees have stood<br>World-famous as Matanga’s wood<br>Still, Raghu’s son, pursue thy way:<br>Through shades where birds are vocal stray,<br>Fair as the blessed wood where rove<br>Immortal Gods, or Nandan’s grove.<br>Near Pampá eastward, full in sight,<br>Stands Rishyamúka’s wood-crowned height.<br>’Tis hard to climb that towering steep<br>Where serpents unmolested sleep.<br>The free and bounteous, formed of old<br>By Brahmá of superior mould,<br>Who sink when day is done to rest<br>Reclining on that mountain crest,—<br>What wealth or joy in dreams they view,<br>Awaking find the vision true.<br>But if a villain stained with crime<br>That holy hill presume to climb,<br>The giants in their fury sweep<br>From the hill top the wretch asleep.<br>There loud and long is heard the roar<br>Of elephants on Pampá’s shore,<br>Who near Matanga’s dwelling stray<br>And in those waters bathe and play.<br>A while they revel by the flood,<br>Their temples stained with streams like blood,<br>Then wander far away dispersed,<br>Dark as huge clouds before they burst.<br>But ere they part they drink their fill<br>Of bright pure water from the rill,<br>Delightful to the touch, where meet<br>Scents of all flowers divinely sweet,<br>Then speeding from the river side<br>Deep in the sheltering thicket hide.<br>Then bears and tigers shalt thou view<br>Whose soft skins show the sapphire’s hue,<br>And silvan deer that wander nigh<br>Shall harmless from thy presence fly.<br>High in that mountain’s wooded side<br>Is a fair cavern deep and wide,<br>Yet hard to enter: piles of rock<br>The portals of the cavern block.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Or as the commentator Tírtha says, Śilápidháná, rock-covered, may be
the name of the cavern.

</span></span><br>Fast by the eastern door a pool<br>Gleams with broad waters fresh and cool,<br>Where stores of roots and fruit abound,<br>And thick trees shade the grassy ground.<br>This mountain cave the virtuous-souled<br>Sugríva, and his Vánars hold,<br>And oft the mighty chieftain seeks<br>The summits of those towering peaks.”<br><br>  Thus spake Kabandha high in air<br>His counsel to the royal pair.<br>Still on his neck that wreath he bore,<br>And radiance like the sun’s he wore.<br>Their eyes the princely brothers raised<br>And on that blissful being gazed:<br>“Behold, we go: no more delay;<br>Begin,” they cried, “thy heavenward way.”<br>“Depart,” Kabandha’s voice replied,<br>“Pursue your search, and bliss betide.”<br><br>  Thus to the happy chiefs he said,<br>Then on his heavenward journey sped.<br>Thus once again Kabandha won<br>A shape that glittered like the sun<br>  Without a spot or stain.<br>Thus bade he Ráma from the air<br>To great Sugríva’s side repair<br>  His friendly love to gain.
