                            When Śavarí had sought the skies<br>And gained her splendid virtue’s prize,<br>Ráma with Lakshmaṇ stayed to brood<br>O’er the strange scenes their eyes had viewed.<br>His mind upon those saints was bent,<br>For power and might preëminent<br>And he to musing Lakshmaṇ spoke<br>The thoughts that in his bosom woke:<br>“Mine eyes this wondrous home have viewed<br>Of those great saints with souls subdued,<br>Where peaceful tigers dwell and birds,<br>And deer abound in heedless herds.<br>Our feet upon the banks have stood<br>Of those seven lakes within the wood,<br>Where we have duly dipped, and paid<br>Libations to each royal shade.<br>Forgotten now are thoughts of ill<br>And joyful hopes my bosom fill.<br>Again my heart is light and gay<br>And grief and care have passed away.<br>Come, brother, let us hasten where<br>Bright Pampá’s flood is fresh and fair,<br>And towering in their beauty near<br>Mount Rishyamúka’s heights appear,<br>Which, offspring of the Lord of Light,<br>Still fearing Báli’s conquering might,<br>With four brave chiefs of Vánar race<br>Sugríva makes his dwelling-place.<br>I long with eager heart to find<br>That leader of the Vánar kind,<br>For on that chief my hopes depend<br>That this our quest have prosperous end.”<br><br>  Thus Ráma spoke, in battle tried,<br>And thus Sumitrá’s son replied:<br>“Come, brother, come, and speed away:<br>My spirit brooks no more delay.”<br>Thus spake Sumitrá’s son, and then<br>Forth from the grove the king of men<br>With his dear brother by his side<br>To Pampá’s lucid waters hied.<br>He gazed upon the woods where grew<br>Trees rich in flowers of every hue.<br>From brake and dell on every side<br>The curlew and the peacock cried,<br>And flocks of screaming parrots made<br>Shrill music in the bloomy shade.<br>His eager eyes, as on he went,<br>On many a pool and tree were bent.<br>Inflamed with love he journeyed on<br>Till a fair flood before him shone.<br>He stood upon the water’s side<br>Which streams from distant hills supplied:<br>Matanga’s name that water bore:<br>There bathed he from the shelving shore.<br>Then, each on earnest thoughts intent,<br>Still farther on their way they went.<br>But Ráma’s heart once more gave way<br>Beneath his grief and wild dismay.<br>Before him lay the noble flood<br>Adorned with many a lotus bud.<br>On its fair banks Aśoka glowed,<br>And all bright trees their blossoms showed.<br>Green banks that silver waves confined<br>With lovely groves were fringed and lined.<br>The crystal waters in their flow<br>Showed level sands that gleamed below.<br>There glittering fish and tortoise played,<br>And bending trees gave pleasant shade.<br>There creepers on the branches hung<br>With lover-like embraces clung.<br>There gay Gandharvas loved to meet,<br>And Kinnars sought the calm retreat.<br>There wandering Yakshas found delight,<br>Snake-gods and rovers of the night.<br>Cool were the pleasant waters, gay<br>Each tree with creeper, flower, and spray.<br>There flushed the lotus darkly red,<br>Here their white glory lilies spread,<br>Here sweet buds showed their tints of blue:<br>So carpets gleam with many a hue.<br>A grove of Mangoes blossomed nigh,<br>Echoing with the peacock’s cry.<br>When Ráma by his brother’s side<br>The lovely flood of Pampá eyed,<br>Decked like a beauty, fair to see<br>With every charm of flower and tree,<br>His mighty heart with woe was rent<br>And thus he spoke in wild lament<br><br>  “Here, Lakshmaṇ, on this beauteous shore,<br>Stands, dyed with tints of many an ore,<br>The mountain Rishyamúka bright<br>With flowery trees that crown each height.<br>Sprung from the chief who, famed of yore,<br>The name of Riksharajas bore,<br>Sugríva, chieftain strong and dread,<br>Dwells on that mountain’s towering head.<br>Go to him, best of men, and seek<br>That prince of Vánars on the peak,<br>I cannot longer brook my pain,<br>Or, Sítá lost, my life retain.”<br>  Thus by the pangs of love distressed,<br>    His thoughts on Sítá bent,<br>  His faithful brother he addressed,<br>    And cried in wild lament.<br>  He reached the lovely ground that lay<br>    On Pampá’s wooded side,<br>  And told in anguish and dismay,<br>    The grief he could not hide.<br>  With listless footsteps faint and slow<br>    His way the chief pursued,<br>  Till Pampá with her glorious show<br>    Of flowering woods he viewed.<br>  Through shades where every bird was found<br>    The prince with Lakshmaṇ passed,<br>  And Pampá with her groves around<br>    Burst on his eyes at last.
