The two<br>Who lingered on the spot, he slew.<br>I fled from mortal danger, freed<br>From the dire shaft by timely speed.<br>Now to deep thought my days I give,<br>And as a humble hermit live.<br>In every shrub, in every tree<br>I view that noblest devotee.<br>In every knotted trunk I mark<br>His deerskin and his coat of bark,<br>And see the bow-armed Ráma stand<br>Like Yáma with his noose in hand.<br>I tell thee Rávaṇ, in my fright<br>A thousand Rámas mock my sight,<br>This wood with every bush and bough<br>Seems all one fearful Ráma now.<br>Throughout the grove there is no spot<br>So lonely where I see him not.<br>He haunts me in my dreams by night,<br>And wakes me with the wild affright.<br>The letter that begins his name<br>Sends terror through my startled frame.<br>The rapid cars whereon we ride,<br>The rich rare jewels, once my pride,<br>Have names<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Sanskrit words for car and jewels begin with<em>&nbsp;ra</em>.

Soothly swear,<br>And Ráma’s fault and sin declare.<br>  I warn thee, and my words are wise,<br>    I seek thy people’s weal:<br>  But if this rede thou wilt despise,<br>    Nor hear my last appeal,<br>  Thou with thy kin and all thy friends<br>    In fight this day wilt die,<br>  When his great bow the hero bends,<br>    And shafts unerring fly.”
