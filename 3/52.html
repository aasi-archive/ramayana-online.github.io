                            Fair as the lord of silvery rays<br>Whom every star in heaven obeys,<br>The Maithil dame her plaint renewed<br>O’er him by Rávaṇ’s might subdued:<br>“Dreams, omens, auguries foreshow<br>Our coming lot of weal and woe:<br>But thou, my Ráma, couldst not see<br>The grievous blow which falls on thee.<br>The birds and deer desert the brakes<br>And show the path my captor takes,<br>And thus e’en now this royal bird<br>Flew to mine aid by pity stirred.<br>Slain for my sake in death he lies,<br>The broad-winged rover of the skies.<br>O Ráma, haste, thine aid I crave:<br>O Lakshmaṇ, why delay to save?<br>Brave sons of old Ikshváku, hear<br>And rescue in this hour of fear.”<br><br>  Her flowery wreath was torn and rent,<br>Crushed was each sparkling ornament.<br>She with weak arms and trembling knees<br>Clung like a creeper to the trees,<br>And like some poor deserted thing<br>With wild shrieks made the forest ring.<br>But swift the giant reached her side,<br>As loud on Ráma’s name she cried.<br>Fierce as grim Death one hand he laid<br>Upon her tresses’ lovely braid.<br>“That touch, thou impious King, shall be<br>The ruin of thy race and thee.”<br>The universal world in awe<br>That outrage on the lady saw,<br>All nature shook convulsed with dread,<br>And darkness o’er the land was spread.<br>The Lord of Day grew dark and chill,<br>And every breath of air was still.<br>The Eternal Father of the sky<br>Beheld the crime with heavenly eye,<br>And spake with solemn voice, “The deed,<br>The deed is done, of old decreed.”<br>Sad were the saints within the grove,<br>But triumph with their sorrow strove.<br>They wept to see the Maithil dame<br>Endure the outrage, scorn, and shame:<br>They joyed because his life should pay<br>The penalty incurred that day.<br>Then Rávaṇ raised her up, and bare<br>His captive through the fields of air,<br>Calling with accents loud and shrill<br>On Ráma and on Lakshmaṇ still.<br>With sparkling gems on arm and breast,<br>In silk of paly amber dressed,<br>High in the air the Maithil dame<br>Gleamed like the lightning’s flashing flame.<br>The giant, as the breezes blew<br>Upon her robes of amber hue,<br>And round him twined that gay attire,<br>Showed like a mountain girt with fire.<br>The lady, fairest of the fair,<br>Had wreathed a garland round her hair;<br>Its lotus petals bright and sweet<br>Rained down about the giant’s feet.<br>Her vesture, bright as burning gold,<br>Gave to the wind each glittering fold,<br>Fair as a gilded cloud that gleams<br>Touched by the Day-God’s tempered beams.<br>Yet struggling in the fiend’s embrace,<br>The lady with her sweet pure face,<br>Far from her lord, no longer wore<br>The light of joy that shone before.<br>Like some sad lily by the side<br>Of waters which the sun has dried;<br>Like the pale moon uprising through<br>An autumn cloud of darkest hue,<br>So was her perfect face between<br>The arms of giant Rávaṇ seen:<br>Fair with the charm of braided tress<br>And forehead’s finished loveliness;<br>Fair with the ivory teeth that shed<br>White lustre through the lips’ fine red,<br>Fair as the lotus when the bud<br>Is rising from the parent flood.<br>With faultless lip and nose and eye,<br>Dear as the moon that floods the sky<br>With gentle light, of perfect mould,<br>She seemed a thing of burnished gold,<br>Though on her cheek the traces lay<br>Of tears her hand had brushed away.<br>But as the moon-beams swiftly fade<br>Ere the great Day-God shines displayed,<br>So in that form of perfect grace<br>Still trembling in the fiend’s embrace,<br>From her beloved Ráma reft,<br>No light of pride or joy was left.<br>The lady with her golden hue<br>O’er the swart fiend a lustre threw,<br>As when embroidered girths enfold<br>An elephant with gleams of gold.<br>Fair as the lily’s bending stem,—<br>Her arms adorned with many a gem,<br>A lustre to the fiend she lent<br>Gleaming from every ornament,<br>As when the cloud-shot flashes light<br>The shadows of a mountain height.<br>Whene’er the breezes earthward bore<br>The tinkling of the zone she wore,<br>He seemed a cloud of darkness hue<br>Sending forth murmurs as it flew.<br>As on her way the dame was sped<br>From her sweet neck fair flowers were shed,<br>The swift wind caught the flowery rain<br>And poured it o’er the fiend again.<br>The wind-stirred blossoms, sweet to smell,<br>On the dark brows of Rávaṇ fell,<br>Like lunar constellations set<br>On Meru for a coronet.<br>From her small foot an anklet fair<br>With jewels slipped, and through the air,<br>Like a bright circlet of the flame<br>Of thunder, to the valley came.<br>The Maithil lady, fair to see<br>As the young leaflet of a tree<br>Clad in the tender hues of spring,<br>Flashed glory on the giant king,<br>As when a gold-embroidered zone<br>Around an elephant is thrown.<br>While, bearing far the lady, through<br>The realms of sky the giant flew,<br>She like a gleaming meteor cast<br>A glory round her as she passed.<br>Then from each limb in swift descent<br>Dropped many a sparkling ornament:<br>On earth they rested dim and pale<br>Like fallen stars when virtues fail.<span

</span></span><br>The birds of every wing had flocked<br>To stately trees by breezes rocked:<br>These bowed their wind-swept heads and said:<br>“My lady sweet, be comforted.”<br>With faded blooms each brook within<br>Whose waters moved no gleamy fin,<br>Stole sadly through the forest dell<br>Mourning the dame it loved so well.<br>From every woodland region near<br>Came lions, tigers, birds, and deer,<br>And followed, each with furious look,<br>The way her flying shadow took.<br>For Sítá’s loss each lofty hill<br>Whose tears were waterfall, and rill,<br>Lifting on high each arm-like steep,<br>Seemed in the general woe to weep.<br>When the great sun, the lord of day,<br>Saw Rávaṇ tear the dame away,<br>His glorious light began to fail<br>And all his disk grew cold and pale.<br>“If Rávaṇ from the forest flies<br>With Ráma’s Sítá as his prize,<br>Justice and truth have vanished hence,<br>Honour and right and innocence.”<br>Thus rose the cry of wild despair<br>From spirits as they gathered there.<br>In trembling troops in open lawns<br>Wept, wild with woe, the startled fawns,<br>And a strange terror changed the eyes<br>They lifted to the distant skies.<br>On silvan Gods who love the dell<br>A sudden fear and trembling fell,<br>As in the deepest woe they viewed<br>The lady by the fiend subdued.<br>Still in loud shrieks was heard afar<br>That voice whose sweetness naught could mar,<br>While eager looks of fear and woe<br>She bent upon the earth below.<br>The lady of each winning wile<br>With pearly teeth and lovely smile,<br>Seized by the lord of Lanká’s isle,<br>  Looked down for friends in vain.<br>She saw no friend to aid her, none,<br>Not Ráma nor the younger son<br>Of Daśaratha, and undone<br>  She swooned with fear and pain.
