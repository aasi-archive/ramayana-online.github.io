                            Thus counselled by their friendly guide<br>On through the wood the princes hied,<br>Pursuing still the eastern road<br>To Pampá which Kabandha showed,<br>Where trees that on the mountains grew<br>With fruit like honey charmed the view.<br>They rested weary for the night<br>Upon a mountain’s wooded height,<br>Then onward with the dawn they hied<br>And stood on Pampá’s western side,<br>Where Śavarí’s fair home they viewed<br>Deep in that shady solitude.<br>The princes reached the holy ground<br>Where noble trees stood thick around,<br>And joying in the lovely view<br>Near to the aged votaress drew.<br>To meet the sons of Raghu came,<br>With hands upraised, the pious dame,<br>And bending low with reverence meet<br>Welcomed them both and pressed their feet.<br>Then water, as beseems, she gave,<br>Their lips to cool, their feet to lave.<br>To that pure saint who never broke<br>One law of duty Ráma spoke:<br><br>  “I trust no cares invade thy peace,<br>While holy works and zeal increase;<br>That thou content with scanty food<br>All touch of ire hast long subdued;<br>That all thy vows are well maintained<br>While peace of mind is surely gained,<br>That reverence of the saints who taught<br>Thy faithful heart due fruit has brought.”<br><br>  The aged votaress pure of taint,<br>Revered by every perfect saint,<br>Rose to her feet by Ráma’s side<br>And thus in gentle tones replied:<br>“My penance meed this day I see<br>Complete, my lord, in meeting thee.<br>This day the fruit of birth I gain,<br>Nor have I served the saints in vain.<br>I reap rich fruits of toil and vow,<br>And heaven itself awaits me now,<br>When I, O chief of men, have done<br>Honour to thee the godlike one.<br>I feel, great lord, thy gentle eye<br>My earthly spirit purify,<br>And I, brave tamer of thy foes,<br>Shall through thy grace in bliss repose.<br>Thy feet by Chitrakúṭa strayed<br>When those great saints whom I obeyed,<br>In dazzling chariots bright of hue,<br>Hence to their heavenly mansions flew.<br>As the high saints were borne away<br>I heard their holy voices say:<br>“In this pure grove, O devotee,<br>Prince Ráma soon will visit thee.<br>When he and Lakshmaṇ seek this shade,<br>Be to thy guests all honour paid.<br>Him shalt thou see, and pass away<br>To those blest worlds which ne’er decay.”<br>To me, O mighty chief, the best<br>Of lofty saints these words addressed.<br>Laid up within my dwelling lie<br>Fruits of each sort which woods supply,—<br>Food culled for thee in endless store<br>From every tree on Pampá’s shore.”<br><br>  Thus to her virtuous guest she sued<br>And he, with heavenly lore endued,<br>Words such as these in turn addressed<br>To her with equal knowledge blest:<br>“Danu himself the power has told<br>Of thy great masters lofty-souled.<br>Now if thou will, mine eyes would fain<br>Assurance of their glories gain.”<br><br>  She heard the prince his wish declare:<br>Then rose she, and the royal pair<br>Of brothers through the wood she led<br>That round her holy dwelling spread.<br>“Behold Matanga’s wood” she cried,<br>“A grove made famous far and wide.<br>Dark as thick clouds and filled with herds<br>Of wandering deer, and joyous birds.<br>In this pure spot each reverend sire<br>With offerings fed the holy fire.<br>See here the western altar stands<br>Where daily with their trembling hands<br>The aged saints, so long obeyed<br>By me, their gifts of blossoms laid.<br>The holy power, O Raghu’s son,<br>By their ascetic virtue won,<br>Still keeps their well-loved altar bright,<br>Filling the air with beams of light.<br>And those seven neighbouring lakes behold<br>Which, when the saints infirm and old,<br>Worn out by fasts, no longer sought,<br>Moved hither drawn by power of thought.<br>Look, Ráma, where the devotees<br>Hung their bark mantles on the trees,<br>Fresh from the bath: those garments wet<br>Through many a day are dripping yet.<br>See, through those aged hermits’ power<br>The tender spray, this bright-hued flower<br>With which the saints their worship paid,<br>Fresh to this hour nor change nor fade.<br>Here thou hast seen each lawn and dell,<br>And heard the tale I had to tell:<br>Permit thy servant, lord, I pray,<br>To cast this mortal shell away,<br>For I would dwell, this life resigned,<br>With those great saints of lofty mind,<br>Whom I within this holy shade<br>With reverential care obeyed.”<br><br>  When Ráma and his brother heard<br>The pious prayer the dame preferred,<br>Filled full of transport and amazed<br>They marvelled as her words they praised.<br>Then Ráma to the votaress said<br>Whose holy vows were perfected:<br>“Go, lady, where thou fain wouldst be,<br>O thou who well hast honoured me.”<br><br>  Her locks in hermit fashion tied,<br>Clad in bark coat and black deer-hide,<br>When Ráma gave consent, the dame<br>Resigned her body to the flame.<br>Then like the fire that burns and glows,<br>To heaven the sainted lady rose,<br>In all her heavenly garments dressed,<br>Immortal wreaths on neck and breast,<br>Bright with celestial gems she shone<br>Most beautiful to look upon,<br>And like the flame of lightning sent<br>A glory through the firmament.<br>That holy sphere the dame attained,<br>By depth of contemplation gained,<br>Where roam high saints with spirits pure<br>In bliss that shall for aye endure.
