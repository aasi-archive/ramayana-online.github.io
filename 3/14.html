reading here, but that it occurs again in verse 29, where it is in
like manner followed in verse 31 by Analá, so that it would
certainly seem that the name Manu is intended to stand for a female,
the daughter of Daksha. The Gauḍa recension, followed by Signor
Gorresio (III 20, 12), adopts an entirely different reading at the
end of the line, viz.<em>&nbsp;Balám Atibalám api</em>, ‘Balá and Atibilá,’
instead of Manu and Analá. I see that Professor Roth s.v. adduces
the authority of the Amara Kosha and of the Commentator on Páṇini
for stating that the word sometimes means ‘the wife of Manu.’ In the
following text of the Mahábhárata I. 2553. also, Manu appears to be
the name of a female:<em>&nbsp;Anaradyam</em>,<em>&nbsp;Manum</em>,<em>&nbsp;Vañsám</em>,<em>&nbsp;Asurám</em>,<em>&nbsp;Márgaṇapriyám</em>,<em>&nbsp;Anúpám</em>,<em>&nbsp;Subhagám</em>,<em>&nbsp;Bhásím iti</em>,<em>&nbsp;Prádhá
vyajayata</em>. Prádhá (daughter of Daksha) bore Anavadyá, Manu, Vanśá,
Márgaṇapriyá, Anúpá, Subhagá. and Bhásí.’ ”<em>&nbsp;Muir’s Sanskrit Text</em>,
