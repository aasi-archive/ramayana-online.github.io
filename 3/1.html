                            When Ráma, valiant hero, stood<br>In the vast shade of Daṇḍak wood,<br>His eyes on every side he bent<br>And saw a hermit settlement,<br>Where coats of bark were hung around,<br>And holy grass bestrewed the ground.<br>Bright with Bráhmanic lustre glowed<br>That circle where the saints abode:<br>Like the hot sun in heaven it shone,<br>Too dazzling to be looked upon.<br>Wild creatures found a refuge where<br>The court, well-swept, was bright and fair,<br>And countless birds and roedeer made<br>Their dwelling in the friendly shade.<br>Beneath the boughs of well-loved trees<br>Oft danced the gay Apsarases.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Heavenly nymphs.
