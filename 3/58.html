                            When Ráma’s deadly shaft had struck<br>The giant in the seeming buck,<br>The chieftain turned him from the place<br>His homeward way again to trace.<br>Then as he hastened onward, fain<br>To look upon his spouse again,<br>Behind him from a thicket nigh<br>Rang out a jackal’s piercing cry.<br>Alarmed he heard the startling shriek<br>That raised his hair and dimmed his cheek,<br>And all his heart was filled with doubt<br>As the shrill jackal’s cry rang out:<br>“Alas, some dire disaster seems<br>Portended by the jackal’s screams.<br>O may the Maithil dame be screened<br>From outrage of each hungry fiend!<br>Alas, if Lakshmaṇ chanced to hear<br>That bitter cry of woe and fear<br>What time Márícha, as he died,<br>With voice that mocked my accents cried,<br>Swift to my side the prince would flee<br>And quit the dame to succour me.<br>Too well I see the demon band<br>The slaughter of my love have planned.<br>Me far from home and Sítá’s view<br>The seeming deer Márícha drew.<br>He led me far through brake and dell<br>Till wounded by my shaft he fell,<br>And as he sank rang out his cry,<br>“O save me, Lakshmaṇ, or I die.”<br>May it be well with both who stayed<br>In the great wood with none to aid,<br>For every fiend is now my foe<br>For Janasthán’s great overthrow,<br>And many an omen seen to-day<br>Has filled my heart with sore dismay.”<br><br>  Such were the thoughts and sad surmise<br>Of Ráma at the jackal’s cries,<br>And all his heart within him burned<br>As to his cot his steps he turned.<br>He pondered on the deer that led<br>His feet to follow where it fled,<br>And sad with many a bitter thought<br>His home in Janasthán he sought.<br>His soul was dark with woe and fear<br>When flocks of birds and troops of deer<br>Move round him from the left, and raised<br>Discordant voices as they gazed.<br>The omens which the chieftain viewed<br>The terror of his soul renewed,<br>When lo, to meet him Lakshmaṇ sped<br>With brows whence all the light had fled.<br>Near and more near the princes came,<br>Each brother’s heart and look the same;<br>Alike on each sad visage lay<br>The signs of misery and dismay,<br>Then Ráma by his terror moved<br>His brother for his fault reproved<br>In leaving Sítá far from aid<br>In the wild wood where giants strayed.<br>Lakshmaṇ’s left hand he took, and then<br>In gentle tones the prince of men,<br>Though sharp and fierce their tenour ran,<br>Thus to his brother chief began:<br><br>  “O Lakshmaṇ, thou art much to blame<br>Leaving alone the Maithil dame,<br>And flying hither to my side:<br>O, may no ill my spouse betide!<br>But ah, I know my wife is dead,<br>And giants on her limbs have fed,<br>So strange, so terrible are all<br>The omens which my heart appal.<br>O Lakshmaṇ, may we yet return<br>The safety of my love to learn.<br>To find the child of Janak still<br>Alive and free from scathe and ill!<br>Each bird with notes of warning screams,<br>Though the hot sun still darts his beams.<br>The moan of deer, the jackal’s yell<br>Of some o’erwhelming misery tell.<br>O mighty brother, still may she,<br>My princess, live from danger free!<br>  That semblance of a golden deer<br>    Allured me far away,<br>  I followed nearer and more near,<br>    And longed to take the prey.<br>  I followed where the quarry fled:<br>    My deadly arrow flew,<br>  And as the dying creature bled,<br>    The giant met my view.<br>  Great fear and pain oppress my heart<br>    That dreads the coming blow,<br>  And through my left eye keenly dart<br>    The throbs that herald woe.<br>  Ah Lakshmaṇ, all these signs dismay,<br>    My soul that sinks with dread,<br>  I know my love is torn away,<br>    Or, haply, she is dead.”
