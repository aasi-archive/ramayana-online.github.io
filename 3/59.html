                            When Ráma saw his brother stand<br>With none beside him, all unmanned,<br>Eager he questioned why he came<br>So far without the Maithil dame:<br>“Where is my wife, my darling, she<br>Who to the wild wood followed me?<br>Where hast thou left my lady, where<br>The dame who chose my lot to share?<br>Where is my love who balms my woe<br>As through the forest wilds I go,<br>Unkinged and banished and disgraced,—<br>My darling of the dainty waist?<br>She nerves my spirit for the strife,<br>She, only she gives zest to life,<br>Dear as my breath is she who vies<br>In charms with daughters of the skies.<br>If Janak’s child be mine no more,<br>In splendour fair as virgin ore,<br>The lordship of the skies and earth<br>To me were prize of little worth.<br>Ah, lives she yet, the Maithil dame,<br>Dear as the soul within this frame?<br>O, let not all my toil be vain,<br>The banishment, the woe and pain!<br>O, let not dark Kaikeyí win<br>The guerdon of her treacherous sin,<br>If, Sítá lost, my days I end,<br>And thou without me homeward wend!<br>O, let not good Kauśalyá shed<br>Her bitter tears to mourn me dead,<br>Nor her proud rival’s hest obey,<br>Strong in her son and queenly sway!<br>Back to my cot will I repair<br>If Sítá live to greet me there,<br>But if my wife have perished, I<br>Reft of my love will surely die.<br>O Lakshmaṇ, if I seek my cot,<br>Look for my love and find her not<br>Sweet welcome with her smile to give,<br>I tell thee, I will cease to live.<br>O answer,—let thy words be plain,—<br>Lives Sítá yet, or is she slain?<br>Didst thou thy sacred trust betray<br>Till ravening giants seized the prey?<br>Ah me, so young, so soft and fair,<br>Lapped in all bliss, untried by care,<br>Rent from her own dear husband, how<br>Will she support her misery now?<br>That voice, O Lakshmaṇ smote thine ear,<br>And filled, I ween, thy heart with fear,<br>When on thy name for succour cried<br>The treacherous giant ere he died.<br>That voice too like mine own, I ween,<br>Was heard by the Videhan queen.<br>She bade thee seek my side to aid,<br>And quickly was the hest obeyed,<br>But ah, thy fault I needs must blame,<br>To leave alone the helpless dame,<br>And let the cruel giants sate<br>The fury of their murderous hate.<br>Those blood-devouring demons all<br>Grieve in their souls for Khara’s fall,<br>And Sítá, none to guard her side,<br>Torn by their cruel hands has died.<br>I sink, O tamer of thy foes,<br>Deep in the sea of whelming woes.<br>What can I now? I must endure<br>The mighty grief that mocks at cure.”<br><br>  Thus, all his thoughts on Sítá bent,<br>To Janasthán the chieftain went,<br>Hastening on with eager stride,<br>And Lakshmaṇ hurried by his side.<br>With toil and thirst and hunger worn,<br>His breast with doubt and anguish torn,<br>  He sought the well-known spot.<br>Again, again he turned to chide<br>With quivering lips which terror dried:<br>  He looked, and found her not.<br>Within his leafy home he sped,<br>Each pleasant spot he visited<br>  Where oft his darling strayed.<br>“’Tis as I feared,” he cried, and there,<br>Yielding to pangs too great to bear,<br>  He sank by grief dismayed.
