                            So Ráma and Sumitrá’s son,<br>When every honour due was done,<br>Slept through the night. When morning broke,<br>The heroes from their rest awoke.<br>Betimes the son of Raghu rose,<br>With gentle Sítá, from repose,<br>And sipped the cool delicious wave<br>Sweet with the scent the lotus gave,<br>Then to the Gods and sacred flame<br>The heroes and the lady came,<br>And bent their heads in honour meet<br>Within the hermit’s pure retreat.<br>When every stain was purged away,<br>They saw the rising Lord of Day:<br>Then to Sutíkshṇa’s side they went,<br>And softly spoke, most reverent:<br><br>  “Well have we slept, O holy lord,<br>Honoured of thee by all adored:<br>Now leave to journey forth we pray:<br>These hermits urge us on our way.<br>We haste to visit, wandering by,<br>The ascetics’ homes that round you lie,<br>And roaming Daṇḍak’s mighty wood<br>To view each saintly brotherhood,<br>For thy permission now we sue,<br>With these high saints to duty true,<br>By penance taught each sense to tame,—<br>In lustre like the smokeless flame.<br>Ere on our brows the sun can beat<br>With fierce intolerable heat.<br>Like some unworthy lord who wins<br>His power by tyranny and sins,<br>O saint, we fain would part.” The three<br>Bent humbly to the devotee.<br>He raised the princes as they pressed<br>His feet, and strained them to his breast;<br>And then the chief of devotees<br>Bespake them both in words like these:<br>“Go with thy brother, Ráma, go,<br>Pursue thy path untouched by woe:<br>Go with thy faithful Sítá, she<br>Still like a shadow follows thee.<br>Roam Daṇḍak wood observing well<br>The pleasant homes where hermits dwell,—<br>Pure saints whose ordered souls adhere<br>To penance rites and vows austere.<br>There plenteous roots and berries grow,<br>And noble trees their blossoms show,<br>And gentle deer and birds of air<br>In peaceful troops are gathered there.<br>There see the full-blown lotus stud<br>The bosom of the lucid flood,<br>And watch the joyous mallard shake<br>The reeds that fringe the pool and lake.<br>See with delighted eye the rill<br>Leap sparkling from her parent hill,<br>And hear the woods that round thee lie<br>Reëcho to the peacock’s cry.<br>And as I bid thy brother, so,<br>Sumitrá’s child, I bid thee go.<br>Go forth, these varied beauties see,<br>And then once more return to me.”<br><br>  Thus spake the sage Sutíkshṇa: both<br>The chiefs assented, nothing loth,<br>Round him with circling steps they paced,<br>Then for the road prepared with haste.<br>There Sítá stood, the dame long-eyed,<br>Fair quivers round their waists she tied,<br>And gave each prince his trusty bow,<br>And sword which ne’er a spot might know.<br>Each took his quiver from her hand.<br>And clanging bow and gleaming brand:<br>Then from the hermits’ home the two<br>Went forth each woodland scene to view.<br>Each beauteous in the bloom of age,<br>Dismissed by that illustrious sage,<br>With bow and sword accoutred, hied<br>Away, and Sítá by their side.
