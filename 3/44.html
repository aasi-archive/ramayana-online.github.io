                            Thus having warned his brother bold<br>He grasped his sword with haft of gold,<br>And bow with triple flexure bent,<br>His own delight and ornament;<br>Then bound two quivers to his side,<br>And hurried forth with eager stride.<br>Soon as the antlered monarch saw<br>The lord of monarchs near him draw,<br>A while with trembling heart he fled,<br>Then turned and showed his stately head.<br>With sword and bow the chief pursued<br>Where’er the fleeing deer he viewed<br>Sending from dell and lone recess<br>The splendour of his loveliness.<br>Now full in view the creature stood<br>Now vanished in the depth of wood;<br>Now running with a languid flight,<br>Now like a meteor lost to sight.<br>With trembling limbs away he sped;<br>Then like the moon with clouds o’erspread<br>Gleamed for a moment bright between<br>The trees, and was again unseen.<br>Thus in the magic deer’s disguise<br>Márícha lured him to the prize,<br>And seen a while, then lost to view,<br>Far from his cot the hero drew.<br>Still by the flying game deceived<br>The hunter’s heart was wroth and grieved,<br>And wearied with the fruitless chase<br>He stayed him in a shady place.<br>Again the rover of the night<br>Enraged the chieftain, full in sight,<br>Slow moving in the coppice near,<br>Surrounded by the woodland deer.<br>Again the hunter sought the game<br>That seemed a while to court his aim:<br>But seized again with sudden dread,<br>Beyond his sight the creature fled.<br>Again the hero left the shade,<br>Again the deer before him strayed.<br>With surer hope and stronger will<br>The hunter longed his prey to kill.<br>Then as his soul impatient grew,<br>An arrow from his side he drew,<br>Resplendent at the sunbeam’s glow,<br>The crusher of the smitten foe.<br>With skillful heed the mighty lord<br>Fixed well shaft and strained the cord.<br>Upon the deer his eyes he bent,<br>And like a fiery serpent went<br>The arrow Brahma’s self had framed,<br>Alive with sparks that hissed and flamed,<br>Like Indra’s flashing levin, true<br>To the false deer the missile flew<br>Cleaving his flesh that wonderous dart<br>Stood quivering in Márícha’s heart.<br>Scarce from the ground one foot he sprang,<br>Then stricken fell with deadly pang.<br>Half lifeless, as he pressed the ground,<br>He gave a roar of awful sound<br>And ere the wounded giant died<br>He threw his borrowed form aside<br>Remembering still his lord’s behest<br>He pondered in his heart how best<br>Sítá might send her guard away,<br>And Rávaṇ seize the helpless prey.<br>The monster knew the time was nigh,<br>And called aloud with eager cry,<br>“Ho, Sítá, Lakshmaṇ” and the tone<br>He borrowed was like Ráma’s own.<br><br>  So by that matchless arrow cleft,<br>The deer’s bright form Márícha left,<br>Resumed his giant shape and size<br>And closed in death his languid eyes.<br>When Ráma saw his awful foe<br>Gasp, smeared with blood, in deadly throe,<br>His anxious thoughts to Sítá sped,<br>And the wise words that Lakshmaṇ said,<br>That this was false Márícha’s art,<br>Returned again upon his heart.<br>He knew the foe he triumphed o’er<br>The name of great Márícha bore.<br>“The fiend,” he pondered, ’ere he died,<br>“Ho, Lakshmaṇ! ho, my Sítá!” cried<br>Ah, if that cry has reached her ear,<br>How dire must be my darling’s fear!<br>And Lakshmaṇ of the mighty arm,<br>What thinks he in his wild alarm?<br>As thus he thought in sad surmise,<br>Each startled hair began to rise,<br>And when he saw the giant slain<br>And thought upon that cry again,<br>His spirit sank and terror pressed<br>Full sorely on the hero’s breast.<br>Another deer he chased and struck,<br>He bore away the the fallen buck,<br>To Janasthán then turned his face<br>And hastened to his dwelling place.
