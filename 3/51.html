                            Rávaṇ’s red eyes in fury rolled:<br>Bright with his armlets’ flashing gold,<br>In high disdain, by passion stirred<br>He rushed against the sovereign bird.<br>With clash and din and furious blows<br>Of murderous battle met the foes:<br>Thus urged by winds two clouds on high<br>Meet warring in the stormy sky.<br>Then fierce the dreadful combat raged<br>As fiend and bird in war engaged,<br>As if two winged mountains sped<br>To dire encounter overhead.<br>Keen pointed arrows thick and fast,<br>In never ceasing fury cast,<br>Rained hurtling on the vulture king<br>And smote him on the breast and wing.<br>But still that noblest bird sustained<br>The cloud of shafts which Rávaṇ rained,<br>And with strong beak and talons bent<br>The body of his foeman rent.<br>Then wild with rage the ten-necked king<br>Laid ten swift arrows on his string,—<br>Dread as the staff of Death were they,<br>So terrible and keen to slay.<br>Straight to his ear the string he drew,<br>Straight to the mark the arrows flew,<br>And pierced by every iron head<br>The vulture’s mangled body bled.<br>One glance upon the car he bent<br>Where Sítá wept with shrill lament,<br>Then heedless of his wounds and pain<br>Rushed at the giant king again.<br>Then the brave vulture with the stroke<br>Of his resistless talons broke<br>The giant’s shafts and bow whereon<br>The fairest pearls and jewels shone.<br>The monster paused, by rage unmanned:<br>A second bow soon armed his hand,<br>Whence pointed arrows swift and true<br>In hundreds, yea in thousands, flew.<br>The monarch of the vultures, plied<br>With ceaseless darts on every side,<br>Showed like a bird that turns to rest<br>Close covered by the branch-built nest.<br>He shook his pinions to repel<br>The storm of arrows as it fell;<br>Then with his talons snapped in two<br>The mighty bow which Rávaṇ drew.<br>Next with terrific wing he smote<br>So fiercely on the giant’s coat,<br>The harness, glittering with the glow<br>Of fire, gave way beneath the blow.<br>With storm of murderous strokes he beat<br>The harnessed asses strong and fleet,—<br>Each with a goblin’s monstrous face<br>And plates of gold his neck to grace.<br>Then on the car he turned his ire,—<br>The will-moved car that shone like fire,<br>And broke the glorious chariot, broke<br>The golden steps and pole and yoke.<br>The chouris and the silken shade<br>Like the full moon to view displayed,<br>Together with the guards who held<br>Those emblems, to the ground he felled.<br>The royal vulture hovered o’er<br>The driver’s head, and pierced and tore<br>With his strong beak and dreaded claws<br>His mangled brow and cheek and jaws.<br>With broken car and sundered bow,<br>His charioteer and team laid low,<br>One arm about the lady wound,<br>Sprang the fierce giant to the ground.<br>Spectators of the combat, all<br>The spirits viewed the monster’s fall:<br>Lauding the vulture every one<br>Cried with glad voice, Well done! well done!<br>But weak with length of days, at last<br>The vulture’s strength was failing fast.<br>The fiend again assayed to bear<br>The lady through the fields of air.<br>But when the vulture saw him rise<br>Triumphant with his trembling prize,<br>Bearing the sword that still was left<br>When other arms were lost or cleft,<br>Once more, impatient of repose,<br>Swift from the earth her champion rose,<br>Hung in the way the fiend would take,<br>And thus addressing Rávaṇ spake:<br>“Thou, King of giants, rash and blind,<br>Wilt be the ruin of thy kind,<br>Stealing the wife of Ráma, him<br>With lightning scars on chest and limb.<br>A mighty host obeys his will<br>And troops of slaves his palace fill;<br>His lords of state are wise and true,<br>Kinsmen has he and retinue.<br>As thirsty travellers drain the cup,<br>Thou drinkest deadly poison up.<br>The rash and careless fool who heeds<br>No coming fruit of guilty deeds,<br>A few short years of life shall see,<br>And perish doomed to death like thee.<br>Say whither wilt thou fly to loose<br>Thy neck from Death’s entangling noose,<br>Caught like the fish that finds too late<br>The hook beneath the treacherous bait?<br>Never, O King—of this be sure—<br>Will Raghu’s fiery sons endure,<br>Terrific in their vengeful rage,<br>This insult to their hermitage.<br>Thy guilty hands this day have done<br>A deed which all reprove and shun,<br>Unworthly of a noble chief,<br>The pillage loved by coward thief.<br>Stay, if thy heart allow thee, stay<br>And meet me in the deadly fray.<br>Soon shall thou stain the earth with gore,<br>And fall as Khara fell before.<br>The fruits of former deeds o’erpower<br>The sinner in his dying hour:<br>And such a fate on thee, O King,<br>Thy tyranny and madness bring.<br>Not e’en the Self-existent Lord,<br>Who reigns by all the worlds adored,<br>Would dare attempt a guilty deed<br>Which the dire fruits of crime succeed.”<br><br>  Thus brave Jaṭáyus, best of birds,<br>Addressed the fiend with moving words,<br>Then ready for the swift attack<br>Swooped down upon the giant’s back.<br>Down to the bone the talons went;<br>With many a wound the flesh was rent:<br>Such blows infuriate drivers deal<br>Their elephants with pointed steel.<br>Fixed in his back the strong beak lay,<br>The talons stripped the flesh away.<br>He fought with claws and beak and wing,<br>And tore the long hair of the king.<br>Still as the royal vulture beat<br>The giant with his wings and feet,<br>Swelled the fiend’s lips, his body shook<br>With furious rage too great to brook.<br>About the Maithil dame he cast<br>One huge left arm and held her fast.<br>In furious rage to frenzy fanned<br>He struck the vulture with his hand.<br>Jatáyus mocked the vain assay,<br>And rent his ten left arms away.<br>Down dropped the severed limbs: anew<br>Ten others from his body grew:<br>Thus bright with pearly radiance glide<br>Dread serpents from the hillock side,<br>Again in wrath the giant pressed<br>The lady closer to his breast,<br>And foot and fist sent blow on blow<br>In ceaseless fury at the foe.<br>So fierce and dire the battle, waged<br>Between those mighty champions, raged:<br>Here was the lord of giants, there<br>The noblest of the birds of air.<br>Thus, as his love of Ráma taught,<br>The faithful vulture strove and fought.<br>But Rávaṇ seized his sword and smote<br>His wings and side and feet and throat.<br>At mangled side and wing he bled;<br>He fell, and life was almost fled.<br>The lady saw her champion lie,<br>His plumes distained with gory dye,<br>And hastened to the vulture’s side<br>Grieving as though a kinsman died.<br>  The lord of Lanká’s island viewed<br>    The vulture as he lay:<br>  Whose back like some dark cloud was hued,<br>    His breast a paly grey,<br>  Like ashes, when by none renewed,<br>    The flame has died away.<br>  The lady saw with mournful eye,<br>    Her champion press the plain,—<br>  The royal bird, her true ally<br>    Whom Rávaṇ’s might had slain.<br>  Her soft arms locked in strict embrace<br>    Around his neck she kept,<br>  And lovely with her moon-bright face<br>    Bent o’er her friend and wept.
