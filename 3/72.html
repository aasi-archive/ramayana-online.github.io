                            “Lord of the mighty arm, of yore<br>A shape transcending thought I wore,<br>And through the triple world’s extent<br>My fame for might and valour went.<br>Scarce might the sun and moon on high,<br>Scarce Śakra, with my beauty vie.<br>Then for a time this form I took,<br>And the great world with trembling shook.<br>The saints in forest shades who dwelt<br>The terror of my presence felt.<br>But once I stirred to furious rage<br>Great Sthúlaśiras, glorious sage.<br>Culling in woods his hermit food<br>My hideous shape with fear he viewed.<br>Then forth his words of anger burst<br>That bade me live a thing accursed:<br>“Thou, whose delight is others’ pain,<br>This grisly form shalt still retain.”<br><br>  Then when I prayed him to relent<br>And fix some term of punishment,—<br>Prayed that the curse at length might cease,<br>He bade me thus expect release:<br>“Let Ráma cleave thine arms away<br>And on the pyre thy body lay,<br>And then shalt thou, set free from doom,<br>Thine own fair shape once more assume.”<br>O Lakshmaṇ, hear my words: in me<br>The world-illustrious Danu see.<br>By Indra’s curse, subdued in fight,<br>I wear this form which scares the sight.<br>By sternest penance long maintained<br>The mighty Father’s grace I gained.<br>When length of days the God bestowed,<br>With foolish pride my bosom glowed.<br>My life, of lengthened years assured,<br>I deemed from Śakra’s might secured.<br>Let by my senseless pride astray<br>I challenged Indra to the fray.<br>A flaming bolt with many a knot<br>With his terrific arm he shot,<br>And straight my head and thighs compressed<br>Were buried in my bulky chest.<br>Deaf to each prayer and piteous call<br>He sent me not to Yáma’s hall.<br>“Thy prayers and cries,” he said “are vain:<br>The Father’s word must true remain.”<br>“But how may lengthened life be spent<br>By one the bolt has torn and rent?<br>How can I live,” I cried, “unfed,<br>With shattered face and thighs and head?”<br>As thus I spoke his grace to crave,<br>Arms each a league in length he gave,<br>And opened in my chest beneath<br>This mouth supplied with fearful teeth.<br>So my huge arms I used to cast<br>Round woodland creatures as they passed,<br>And fed within the forest here<br>On lion, tiger, pard, and deer.<br>Then Indra spake to soothe my grief:<br>“When Ráma and his brother chief<br>From thy huge bulk those arms shall cleave,<br>Then shall the skies thy soul receive.”<br>Disguised in this terrific shape<br>I let no woodland thing escape,<br>And still my longing soul was pleased<br>Whene’er my arms a victim seized,<br>For in these arms I fondly thought<br>Would Ráma’s self at last be caught.<br>Thus hoping, toiling many a day<br>I yearned to cast my life away,<br>And here, my lord, thou standest now:<br>Blessings be thine! for none but thou<br>Could cleave my arms with trenchant stroke:<br>True are the words the hermit spoke.<br>Now let me, best of warriors, lend<br>My counsel, and thy plans befriend,<br>And aid thee with advice in turn<br>If thou with fire my corse wilt burn.”<br><br>  As thus the mighty Danu prayed<br>With offer of his friendly aid,<br>While Lakshmaṇ gazed with anxious eye,<br>The virtuous Ráma made reply:<br>“Lakshmaṇ and I through forest shade<br>From Janasthán a while had strayed.<br>When none was near her, Rávaṇ came<br>And bore away my glorious dame,<br>The giant’s form and size unknown,<br>I learn as yet his name alone.<br>Not yet the power and might we know<br>Or dwelling of the monstrous foe.<br>With none our helpless feet to guide<br>We wander here by sorrow tried.<br>Let pity move thee to requite<br>Our service in the funeral rite.<br>Our hands shall bring the boughs that, dry<br>Where elephants have rent them, lie,<br>Then dig a pit, and light the fire<br>To burn thee as the laws require.<br>Do thou as meed of this declare<br>Who stole my spouse, his dwelling where.<br>O, if thou can, I pray thee say,<br>And let this grace our deeds repay.”<br><br>  Danu had lent attentive ear<br>The words which Ráma spoke to hear,<br>And thus, a speaker skilled and tried,<br>To that great orator replied:<br>“No heavenly lore my soul endows,<br>Naught know I of thy Maithil spouse.<br>Yet will I, when my shape I wear,<br>Him who will tell thee all declare.<br>Then, Ráma, will my lips disclose<br>His name who well that giant knows.<br>But till the flames my corse devour<br>This hidden knowledge mocks my power.<br>For through that curse’s withering taint<br>My knowledge now is small and faint.<br>Unknown the giant’s very name<br>Who bore away the Maithil dame.<br>Cursed for my evil deeds I wore<br>A shape which all the worlds abhor.<br>Now ere with wearied steeds the sun<br>Through western skies his course have run,<br>Deep in a pit my body lay<br>And burn it in the wonted way.<br>When in the grave my corse is placed,<br>With fire and funeral honours graced,<br>Then I, great chief, his name will tell<br>Who knows the giant robber well.<br>With him, who guides his life aright,<br>In league of trusting love unite,<br>And he, O valiant prince, will be<br>A faithful friend and aid to thee.<br>For, Ráma, to his searching eyes<br>The triple world uncovered lies.<br>For some dark cause of old, I ween,<br>Through all the spheres his ways have been.”
