                            The words that Sítá uttered, spurred<br>By truest love, the hero heard:<br>Then he who ne’er from virtue strayed<br>To Janak’s child his answer made:<br>“In thy wise speech, sweet love, I find<br>True impress of thy gentle mind,<br>Well skilled the warrior’s path to trace,<br>Thou pride of Janak’s ancient race.<br>What fitting answer shall I frame<br>To thy good words, my honoured dame?<br>Thou sayst the warrior bears the bow<br>That misery’s tears may cease to flow;<br>And those pure saints who love the shade<br>Of Daṇḍak wood are sore dismayed.<br>They sought me of their own accord,<br>With suppliant prayers my aid implored:<br>They, fed on roots and fruit, who spend<br>Their lives where bosky wilds extend,<br>My timid love, enjoy no rest<br>By these malignant fiends distressed.<br>These make the flesh of man their meat:<br>The helpless saints they kill and eat.<br>The hermits sought my side, the chief<br>Of Bráhman race declared their grief.<br>I heard, and from my lips there fell<br>The words which thou rememberest well:<br>I listened as the hermits cried,<br>And to their prayers I thus replied:<br><br>  “Your favour, gracious lords, I claim,<br>O’erwhelmed with this enormous shame<br>That Bráhmans, great and pure as you,<br>Who should be sought, to me should sue.”<br>And then before the saintly crowd,<br>“What can I do?” I cried aloud.<br>Then from the trembling hermits broke<br>One long sad cry, and thus they spoke:<br>“Fiends of the wood, who wear at will<br>Each varied shape, afflict us still.<br>To thee in our distress we fly:<br>O help us, Ráma, or we die.<br>When sacred rites of fire are due,<br>When changing moons are full or new,<br>These fiends who bleeding flesh devour<br>Assail us with resistless power.<br>They with their cruel might torment<br>The hermits on their vows intent:<br>We look around for help and see<br>Our surest refuge, Prince, in thee.<br>We, armed with powers of penance, might<br>Destroy the rovers of the night:<br>But loth were we to bring to naught<br>The merit years of toil have bought.<br>Our penance rites are grown too hard,<br>By many a check and trouble barred,<br>But though our saints for food are slain<br>The withering curse we yet restrain.<br>Thus many a weary day distressed<br>By giants who this wood infest,<br>We see at length deliverance, thou<br>With Lakshmaṇ art our guardian now.”<br><br>  As thus the troubled hermits prayed,<br>I promised, dame, my ready aid,<br>And now—for truth I hold most dear—<br>Still to my word must I adhere.<br>My love, I might endure to be<br>Deprived of Lakshmaṇ, life, and thee,<br>But ne’er deny my promise, ne’er<br>To Bráhmans break the oath I sware.<br>I must, enforced by high constraint,<br>Protect them all. Each suffering saint<br>In me, unasked, his help had found;<br>Still more in one by promise bound.<br>I know thy words, mine own dear dame,<br>From thy sweet heart’s affection came:<br>I thank thee for thy gentle speech,<br>For those we love are those we teach.<br>’Tis like thyself, O fair of face,<br>’Tis worthy of thy noble race:<br>Dearer than life, thy feet are set<br>In righteous paths they ne’er forget.”<br><br>  Thus to the Maithil monarch’s child,<br>His own dear wife, in accents mild<br>    The high-souled hero said:<br>Then to the holy groves which lay<br>Beyond them fair to see, their way<br>    The bow-armed chieftain led.
