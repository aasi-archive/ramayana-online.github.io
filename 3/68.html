                            Thus faithful Lakshmaṇ strove to cheer<br>The prince with counsel wise and clear.<br>Who, prompt to seize the pith of all,<br>Let not that wisdom idly fall.<br>With vigorous effort he restrained<br>The passion in his breast that reigned,<br>And leaning on his bow for rest<br>His brother Lakshmaṇ thus addressed:<br>“How shall we labour now, reflect;<br>Whither again our search direct?<br>Brother, what plan canst thou devise<br>To bring her to these longing eyes?”<br><br>  To him by toil and sorrow tried<br>The prudent Lakshmaṇ thus replied:<br>“Come, though our labour yet be vain,<br>And search through Janasthán again,—<br>A realm where giant foes abound,<br>And trees and creepers hide the ground.<br>For there are caverns deep and dread,<br>By deer and wild birds tenanted,<br>And hills with many a dark abyss,<br>Grotto and rock and precipice.<br>There bright Gandharvas love to dwell,<br>And Kinnars in each bosky dell.<br>With me thy eager search to aid<br>Be every hill and cave surveyed.<br>Great chiefs like thee, the best of men,<br>Endowed with sense and piercing ken,<br>Though tried by trouble never fail,<br>Like rooted hills that mock the gale.”<br><br>  Then Ráma, pierced by anger’s sting,<br>Laid a keen arrow on his string,<br>And by the faithful Lakshmaṇ’s side<br>Roamed through the forest far and wide.<br>Jaṭáyus there with blood-drops dyed,<br>Lying upon the ground he spied,<br>Huge as a mountain’s shattered crest,<br>Mid all the birds of air the best.<br>In wrath the mighty bird he eyed,<br>And thus the chief to Lakshmaṇ cried:<br><br>  “Ah me, these signs the truth betray;<br>My darling was the vulture’s prey.<br>Some demon in the bird’s disguise<br>Roams through the wood that round us lies.<br>On large-eyed Sítá he has fed,<br>And rests him now with wings outspread.<br>But my keen shafts whose flight is true,<br>Shall pierce the ravenous monster through.”<br><br>  An arrow on the string he laid,<br>And rushing near the bird surveyed,<br>While earth to ocean’s distant side<br>Trembled beneath his furious stride.<br>With blood and froth on neck and beak<br>The dying bird essayed to speak,<br>And with a piteous voice, distressed,<br>Thus Daśaratha’s son addressed:<br><br>  “She whom like some sweet herb of grace<br>Thou seekest in this lonely place,<br>Fair lady, is fierce Rávaṇ’s prey,<br>Who took, beside, my life away.<br>Lakshmaṇ and thou had parted hence<br>And left the dame without defence.<br>I saw her swiftly borne away<br>By Rávaṇ’s might which none could stay.<br>I hurried to the lady’s aid,<br>I crushed his car and royal shade,<br>And putting forth my warlike might<br>Hurled Rávaṇ to the earth in fight.<br>Here, Ráma, lies his broken bow,<br>Here lie the arrows of the foe.<br>There on the ground before thee are<br>The fragments of his battle car.<br>There bleeds the driver whom my wings<br>Beat down with ceaseless buffetings.<br>When toil my aged strength subdued,<br>His sword my weary pinions hewed.<br>Then lifting up the dame he bare<br>His captive through the fields of air.<br>Thy vengeful blows from me restrain,<br>Already by the giant slain.”<br><br>  When Ráma heard the vulture tell<br>The tale that proved his love so well,<br>His bow upon the ground he placed,<br>And tenderly the bird embraced:<br>Then to the earth he fell o’erpowered,<br>And burning tears both brothers showered,<br>For double pain and anguish pressed<br>Upon the patient hero’s breast.<br>The solitary bird he eyed<br>Who in the lone wood gasped and sighed,<br>And as again his anguish woke<br>Thus Ráma to his brother spoke:<br><br>  “Expelled from power the woods I tread,<br>My spouse is lost, the bird is dead.<br>A fate so sad, I ween, would tame<br>The vigour of the glorious flame.<br>If I to cool my fever tried<br>To cross the deep from side to side,<br>The sea,—so hard my fate,—would dry<br>His waters as my feet came nigh.<br>In all this world there lives not one<br>So cursed as I beneath the sun;<br>So strong a net of misery cast<br>Around me holds the captive fast,<br>Best of all birds that play the wing,<br>Loved, honoured by our sire the king,<br>The vulture, in my fate enwound,<br>Lies bleeding, dying on the ground.”<br><br>  Then Ráma and his brother stirred<br>By pity mourned the royal bird,<br>And, as their hands his limbs caressed,<br>Affection for a sire expressed.<br>And Ráma to his bosom strained<br>The bird with mangled wings distained,<br>  With crimson blood-drops dyed.<br>He fell, and shedding many a tear,<br>“Where is my spouse than life more dear?<br>  Where is my love?” he cried.
