                            While Khara, urged by valiant rage,<br>Drew near that little hermitage,<br>Those wondrous signs in earth and sky<br>Smote on each prince’s watchful eye.<br>When Ráma saw those signs of woe<br>Fraught with destruction to the foe,<br>With bold impatience scarce repressed<br>His brother chief he thus addressed:<br><br>  “These fearful signs, my brother bold,<br>Which threaten all our foes, behold:<br>All laden, as they strike the view,<br>With ruin to the fiendish crew.<br>The angry clouds are gathering fast,<br>Their skirts with dusty gloom o’ercast,<br>And harsh with loud-voiced thunder, rain<br>Thick drops of blood upon the plain.<br>See, burning for the coming fight,<br>My shafts with wreaths of smoke are white,<br>And my great bow embossed with gold<br>Throbs eager for the master’s hold.<br>Each bird that through the forest flies<br>Sends out its melancholy cries.<br>All signs foretell the dangerous strife,<br>The jeopardy of limb and life.<br>Each sight, each sound gives warning clear<br>That foemen meet and death is near.<br>But courage, valiant brother! well<br>The throbbings of mine arm foretell<br>That ruin waits the hostile powers,<br>And triumph in the fight is ours.<br>I hail the welcome omen: thou<br>Art bright of face and clear of brow.<br>For Lakshmaṇ, when the eye can trace<br>A cloud upon the warrior’s face<br>Stealing the cheerful light away,<br>His life is doomed in battle fray.<br>List, brother, to that awful cry:<br>With shout and roar the fiends draw nigh.<br>With thundering beat of many a drum<br>The savage-hearted giants come.<br>The wise who value safety know<br>To meet, prepared, the coming blow:<br>In paths of prudence trained aright<br>They watch the stroke before it smite.<br>Take thou thine arrows and thy bow,<br>And with the Maithil lady go<br>For shelter to the mountain cave<br>Where thickest trees their branches wave.<br>I will not have thee, Lakshmaṇ, say<br>One word in answer, but obey.<br>By all thy honour for these feet<br>Of mine, dear brother, I entreat.<br>Thy warlike arm, I know could, smite<br>To death these rovers of the night;<br>But I this day would fight alone<br>Till all the fiends be overthrown.”<br>He spake: and Lakshmaṇ answered naught:<br>His arrows and his bow he brought,<br>And then with Sítá following hied<br>For shelter to the mountain side.<br>As Lakshmaṇ and the lady through<br>The forest to the cave withdrew,<br>“’Tis well,” cried Ráma. Then he braced<br>His coat of mail around his waist.<br>When, bright as blazing fire, upon<br>His mighty limbs that armour shone,<br>The hero stood like some great light<br>Uprising in the dark of night.<br>His dreadful shafts were by his side;<br>His trusty bow he bent and plied,<br>Prepared he stood: the bowstring rang,<br>Filling the welkin with the clang.<br><br>  The high-souled Gods together drew<br>The wonder of the fight to view,<br>The saints made free from spot and stain,<br>And bright Gandharvas’ heavenly train.<br>Each glorious sage the assembly sought,<br>Each saint divine of loftiest thought,<br>And filled with zeal for Ráma’s sake.<br>Thus they whose deeds were holy spake:<br><br>  “Now be it well with Bráhmans, now<br>Well with the worlds and every cow!<br>Let Ráma in the deadly fray<br>The fiends who walk in darkness slay,<br>As He who bears the discus<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Vishṇu, who bears a<em>&nbsp;chakra</em> or discus.
