                            But Ráma ceased not to upbraid,<br>His brother for untimely aid,<br>And thus, while anguish wrung his breast,<br>The chief with eager question pressed:<br>“Why, Lakshmaṇ, didst thou hurry hence<br>And leave my wife without defence?<br>I left her in the wood with thee,<br>And deemed her safe from jeopardy.<br>When first thy form appeared in view,<br>I marked that Sítá came not too.<br>With woe my troubled soul was rent,<br>Prophetic of the dire event.<br>Thy coming steps afar I spied,<br>I saw no Sítá by thy side,<br>And felt a sudden throbbing dart<br>Through my left eye, and arm, and heart.”<br><br>  Lakshmaṇ, with Fortune’s marks impressed,<br>His brother mournfully addressed:<br>“Not by my heart’s free impulse led,<br>Leaving thy wife to thee I sped;<br>But by her keen reproaches sent,<br>O Ráma, to thine aid I went.<br>She heard afar a mournful cry,<br>“O save me, Lakshmaṇ, or I die.”<br>The voice that spoke in moving tone<br>Smote on her ear and seemed thine own.<br>Soon as those accents reached her ear<br>She yielded to her woe and fear,<br>She wept o’ercome by grief, and cried,<br>“Fly, Lakshmaṇ, fly to Ráma’s side.”<br>Though many a time she bade me speed,<br>Her urgent prayer I would not heed.<br>I bade her in thy strength confide,<br>And thus with tender words replied:<br>“No giant roams the forest shade<br>From whom thy lord need shrink dismayed.<br>No human voice, believe me, spoke<br>Those words thy causeless fear that woke.<br>Can he whose might can save in woe<br>The heavenly Gods e’er stoop so low,<br>And with those piteous accents call<br>For succour like a caitiff thrall?<br>And why should wandering giants choose<br>The accents of thy lord to use,<br>In alien tones my help to crave,<br>And cry aloud, O Lakshmaṇ, save?<br>Now let my words thy spirit cheer,<br>Compose thy thoughts and banish fear.<br>In hell, in earth, or in the skies<br>There is not, and there cannot rise<br>A champion whose strong arm can slay<br>Thy Ráma in the battle fray.<br>To heavenly hosts he ne’er would yield<br>Though Indra led them to the field.”<br>To soothe her thus I vainly sought:<br>Her heart with woe was still distraught.<br>While from her eyes the waters ran<br>Her bitter speech she thus began:<br>“Too well I see thy dark intent:<br>Thy lawless thoughts on me are bent.<br>Thou hopest, but thy hope is vain,<br>To win my love, thy brother slain.<br>Not love, but Bharat’s dark decree<br>To share his exile counselled thee,<br>Or hearing now his bitter cry<br>Thou surely to his aid wouldst fly.<br>For love of me, a stealthy foe<br>Thou choosest by his side to go,<br>And now thou longest that my lord<br>Should die, and wilt no help afford.”<br><br>  Such were the words the lady said:<br>With angry fire my eyes were red.<br>With pale lips quivering in my rage<br>I hastened from the hermitage.”<br>He ceased; and frenzied by his pain<br>The son of Raghu spoke again:<br>“O brother, for thy fault I grieve,<br>The Maithil dame alone to leave.<br>Thou knowest that my arm is strong<br>To save me from the giant throng,<br>And yet couldst leave the cottage, spurred<br>To folly by her angry word.<br>For this thy deed I praise thee not,—<br>To leave her helpless in the cot,<br>And thus thy sacred charge forsake<br>For the wild words a woman spake.<br>Yea thou art all to blame herein,<br>And very grievous is thy sin.<br>That anger swayed thy faithless breast<br>And made thee false to my behest.<br>An arrow speeding from my bow<br>Has laid the treacherous giant low,<br>Who lured me eager for the chase<br>Far from my hermit dwelling-place.<br>The string with easy hand I drew,<br>The arrow as in pastime flew,<br>  The wounded quarry bled.<br>The borrowed form was cast away,<br>Before mine eye a giant lay<br>  With bright gold braceleted.<br>My arrow smote him in the chest:<br>The giant by the pain distressed<br>  Raised his loud voice on high.<br>Far rang the mournful sound: mine own,<br>It seemed, were accent, voice, and tone,<br>They made thee leave my spouse alone<br>  And to my rescue fly.”
