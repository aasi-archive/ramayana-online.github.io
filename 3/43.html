</span></span> stray.<br>But never, as they wandered by,<br>Has such a beauty charmed mine eye<br>As this with limbs so fair and slight,<br>So gentle, beautiful and bright.<br>O see, how fair it is to view<br>With jewels of each varied hue:<br>Bright as the rising moon it glows,<br>Lighting the wood where’er it goes.<br>Ah me, what form and grace are there!<br>Its limbs how fine, its hues how fair!<br>Transcending all that words express,<br>It takes my soul with loveliness.<br>O, if thou would, to please me, strive<br>To take the beauteous thing alive,<br>How thou wouldst gaze with wondering eyes<br>Delighted on the lovely prize!<br>And when our woodland life is o’er,<br>And we enjoy our realm once more,<br>The wondrous animal will grace<br>The chambers of my dwelling-place,<br>And a dear treasure will it be<br>To Bharat and the queens and me,<br>And all with rapture and amaze<br>Upon its heavenly form will gaze.<br>But if the beauteous deer, pursued,<br>Thine arts to take it still elude,<br>Strike it, O chieftain, and the skin<br>Will be a treasure, laid within.<br>O, how I long my time to pass<br>Sitting upon the tender grass,<br>With that soft fell beneath me spread<br>Bright with its hair of golden thread!<br>This strong desire, this eager will,<br>Befits a gentle lady ill:<br>But when I first beheld, its look<br>My breast with fascination took.<br>See, golden hair its flank adorns,<br>And sapphires tip its branching horns.<br>Resplendent as the lunar way,<br>Or the first blush of opening day,<br>With graceful form and radiant hue<br>It charmed thy heart, O chieftain, too.”<br><br>  He heard her speech with willing ear,<br>He looked again upon the deer.<br>Its lovely shape his breast beguiled<br>Moved by the prayer of Janak’s child,<br>And yielding for her pleasure’s sake,<br>To Lakshmaṇ Ráma turned and spake:<br><br>  “Mark, Lakshmaṇ, mark how Sítá’s breast<br>With eager longing is possessed.<br>To-day this deer of wondrous breed<br>Must for his passing beauty bleed,<br>Brighter than e’er in Nandan strayed,<br>Or Chaitraratha’s heavenly shade.<br>How should the groves of earth possess<br>Such all-surpassing loveliness!<br>The hair lies smooth and bright and fine,<br>Or waves upon each curving line,<br>And drops of living gold bedeck<br>The beauty of his side and neck.<br>O look, his crimson tongue between<br>His teeth like flaming fire is seen,<br>Flashing, whene’er his lips he parts,<br>As from a cloud the lightning darts.<br>O see his sunlike forehead shine<br>With emerald tints and almandine,<br>While pearly light and roseate glow<br>Of shells adorn his neck below.<br>No eye on such a deer can rest<br>But soft enchantment takes the breast:<br>No man so fair a thing behold<br>Ablaze with light of radiant gold,<br>Celestial, bright with jewels’ sheen,<br>Nor marvel when his eyes have seen.<br>A king equipped with bow and shaft<br>Delights in gentle forest craft,<br>And as in boundless woods he strays<br>The quarry for the venison slays.<br>There as he wanders with his train<br>A store of wealth he oft may gain.<br>He claims by right the precious ore,<br>He claims the jewels’ sparkling store.<br>Such gains are dearer in his eyes<br>Than wealth that in his chamber lies,<br>The dearest things his spirit knows,<br>Dear as the bliss which Śukra chose.<br>But oft the rich expected gain<br>Which heedless men pursue in vain,<br>The sage, who prudent counsels know,<br>Explain and in a moment show.<br>This best of deer, this gem of all,<br>To yield his precious spoils must fall,<br>And tender Sítá by my side<br>Shall sit upon the golden hide.<br>Ne’er could I find so rich a coat<br>On spotted deer or sheep or goat.<br>No buck or antelope has such,<br>So bright to view, so soft to touch.<br>This radiant deer and one on high<br>That moves in glory through the sky,<br>Alike in heavenly beauty are,<br>One on the earth and one a star.<br>But, brother, if thy fears be true,<br>And this bright creature that we view<br>Be fierce Márícha in disguise,<br>Then by this hand he surely dies.<br>For that dire fiend who spurns control<br>With bloody hand and cruel soul,<br>Has roamed this forest and dismayed<br>The holiest saints who haunt the shade.<br>Great archers, sprung of royal race,<br>Pursuing in the wood the chase,<br>Have fallen by his wicked art,<br>And now my shaft shall strike his heart.<br>Vatápi, by his magic power<br>Made heedless saints his flesh devour,<br>Then, from within their frames he rent<br>Forth bursting from imprisonment.<br>But once his art in senseless pride<br>Upon the mightiest saint he tried,<br>Agastya’s self, and caused him taste<br>The baited meal before him placed.<br>Vátápi, when the rite was o’er,<br>Would take the giant form he wore,<br>But Saint Agastya knew his wile<br>And checked the giant with smile.<br>“Vátápi, thou with cruel spite<br>Hast conquered many an anchorite<br>The noblest of the Bráhman caste,—<br>And now thy ruin comes at last.”<br>Now if my power he thus defies,<br>This giant, like Vátápi dies,<br>Daring to scorn a man like me,<br>A self subduing devotee.<br>Yea, as Agastya slew the foe,<br>My hand shall lay Márícha low<br>Clad in thine arms thy bow in hand,<br>To guard the Maithil lady stand,<br>With watchful eye and thoughtful breast<br>Keeping each word of my behest<br>I go, and hunting through the brake<br>This wondrous deer will bring or take.<br>Yea surely I will bring the spoil<br>Returning from my hunter’s toil<br>See, Lakshmaṇ how my consort’s eyes<br>Are longing for the lovely prize.<br>This day it falls, that I may win<br>The treasure of so fair a skin.<br>Do thou and Sítá watch with care<br>Lest danger seize you unaware.<br>Swift from my bow one shaft will fly;<br>The stricken deer will fall and die<br>Then quickly will I strip the game<br>And bring the trophy to my dame.<br>  Jaṭáyus, guardian good and wise,<br>    Our old and faithful friend,<br>  The best and strongest bird that flies,<br>    His willing aid will lend<br>  The Maithil lady well protect,<br>    For every chance provide,<br>  And in thy tender care suspect<br>    A foe on every side.”
