                            Low in the dust he saw her lie,<br>And Khara’s wrath grew fierce and high.<br>Aloud he cried to her who came<br>Disgracefully with baffled aim:<br>“I sent with thee at thy request<br>The bravest of my giants, best<br>Of all who feed upon the slain:<br>Why art thou weeping here again?<br>Still to their master’s interest true,<br>My faithful, noble, loyal crew,<br>Though slaughtered in the bloody fray,<br>Would yet their monarch’s word obey.<br>Now I, my sister, fain would know<br>The cause of this thy fear and woe,<br>Why like a snake thou writhest there,<br>Calling for aid in wild despair.<br>Nay, lie not thus in lowly guise:<br>Cast off thy weakness and arise!”<br><br>  With soothing words the giant chief<br>Assuaged the fury of her grief.<br>Her weeping eyes she slowly dried<br>And to her brother thus replied:<br>“I sought thee in my shame and fear<br>With severed nose and mangled ear:<br>My gashes like a river bled,<br>I sought thee and was comforted.<br>Those twice seven giants, brave and strong,<br>Thou sentest to avenge the wrong,<br>To lay the savage Ráma low,<br>And Lakshmaṇ who misused me so.<br>But ah, the shafts of Ráma through<br>The bodies of my champions flew:<br>Though madly fierce their spears they plied,<br>Beneath his conquering might they died.<br>I saw them, famed for strength and speed,<br>I saw my heroes fall and bleed:<br>Great trembling seized my every limb<br>At the great deed achieved by him.<br>In trouble, horror, doubt, and dread,<br>Again to thee for help I fled.<br>While terror haunts my troubled sight,<br>I seek thee, rover of the night.<br>And canst thou not thy sister free<br>From this wide waste of troublous sea<br>Whose sharks are doubt and terror, where<br>Each wreathing wave is dark despair?<br>Low lie on earth thy giant train<br>By ruthless Ráma’s arrows slain,<br>And all the mighty demons, fed<br>On blood, who followed me are dead.<br>Now if within thy breast may be<br>Pity for them and love for me,<br>If thou, O rover of the night,<br>Have valour and with him can fight,<br>Subdue the giants’ cruel foe<br>Who dwells where Daṇḍak’s thickets grow.<br>But if thine arm in vain assay<br>This queller of his foes to slay,<br>Now surely here before thine eyes,<br>Wronged and ashamed thy sister dies.<br>Too well, alas, too well I see<br>That, strong in war as thou mayst be,<br>Thou canst not in the battle stand<br>When Ráma meets thee hand to hand.<br>Go forth, thou hero but in name,<br>Assuming might thou canst not claim;<br>Call friend and kin, no longer stay:<br>Away from Janasthán, away!<br>Shame of thy race! the weak alone<br>Beneath thine arm may sink o’erthrown:<br>Fly Ráma and his brother: they<br>Are men too strong for thee to slay.<br>How canst thou hope, O weak and base,<br>To make this grove thy dwelling-place?<br>With Ráma’s might unmeet to vie,<br>O’ermastered thou wilt quickly die.<br>A hero strong in valorous deed<br>Is Ráma, Daśaratha’s seed:<br>And scarce of weaker might than he<br>His brother chief who mangled me.”<br><br>  Thus wept and wailed in deep distress<br>The grim misshapen giantess:<br>Before her brother’s feet she lay<br>O’erwhelmed with grief, and swooned away.
