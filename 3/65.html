                            With piteous voice, by woe subdued,<br>Thus Raghu’s son his speech renewed:<br><br>  “Thy steps, my brother, quickly turn<br>To bright Godávarí and learn<br>If Sítá to the stream have hied<br>To cull the lilies on its side.”<br><br>  Obedient to the words he said,<br>His brother to the river sped.<br>The shelving banks he searched in vain,<br>And then to Ráma turned again.<br><br>  “I searched, but found her not,” he cried;<br>“I called aloud, but none replied.<br>Where can the Maithil lady stray,<br>Whose sight would chase our cares away?<br>I know not where, her steps untraced,<br>Roams Sítá of the dainty waist.”<br><br>  When Ráma heard the words he spoke<br>Again he sank beneath the stroke,<br>And with a bosom anguish-fraught<br>Himself the lovely river sought.<br>There standing on the shelving side,<br>“O Sítá, where art thou?” he cried.<br>No spirit voice an answer gave,<br>No murmur from the trembling wave<br>Of sweet Godávarí declared<br>The outrage which the fiend had dared.<br>“O speak!” the pitying spirits cried,<br>But yet the stream their prayer denied,<br>Nor dared she, coldly mute, relate<br>To the sad chief his darling’s fate<br>Of Rávaṇ’s awful form she thought,<br>And the dire deed his arm had wrought,<br>And still withheld by fear dismayed,<br>The tale for which the mourner prayed.<br>When hope was none, his heart to cheer,<br>That the bright stream his cry would hear<br>While sorrow for his darling tore<br>His longing soul he spake once more:<br>“Though I have sought with tears and sighs<br>Godárvarí no word replies,<br>O say, what answer can I frame<br>To Janak, father of my dame?<br>Or how before her mother stand<br>Leading no Sítá by the hand?<br>Where is my loyal love who went<br>Forth with her lord to banishment?<br>Her faith to me she nobly held<br>Though from my realm and home expelled,—<br>A hermit, nursed on woodland fare,—<br>She followed still and soothed my care.<br>Of all my friends am I bereft,<br>Nor is my faithful consort left.<br>How slowly will the long nights creep<br>While comfortless I wake and weep!<br>O, if my wife may yet be found,<br>With humble love I’ll wander round<br>This Janasthán, Praśravaṇ’s hill,<br>Mandákiní’s delightful rill.<br>See how the deer with gentle eyes<br>Look on my face and sympathize.<br>I mark their soft expression: each<br>Would soothe me, if it could, with speech.”<br><br>  A while the anxious throng he eyed.<br>And “Where is Sítá, where?” he cried.<br>Thus while hot tears his utterance broke<br>The mourning son of Raghu spoke.<br>The deer in pity for his woes<br>Obeyed the summons and arose.<br>Upon his right thy stood, and raised<br>Their sad eyes up to heaven and gazed<br>Each to that quarter bent her look<br>Which Rávaṇ with his captive took.<br>Then Raghu’s son again they viewed,<br>And toward that point their way pursued.<br>Then Lakshmaṇ watched their looks intent<br>As moaning on their way they went,<br>And marked each sign which struck his sense<br>With mute expressive influence,<br>Then as again his sorrow woke<br>Thus to his brother chief he spoke:<br>“Those deer thy eager question heard<br>And rose at once by pity stirred:<br>See, in thy search their aid they lend,<br>See, to the south their looks they bend.<br>Arise, dear brother, let us go<br>The way their eager glances show,<br>If haply sign or trace descried<br>Our footsteps in the search may guide.”<br><br>  The son of Raghu gave assent,<br>And quickly to the south they went;<br>With eager eyes the earth he scanned,<br>And Lakshmaṇ followed close at hand.<br>As each to other spake his thought,<br>And round with anxious glances sought,<br>Scattered before them in the way,<br>Blooms of a fallen garland lay.<br>When Ráma saw that flowery rain<br>He spoke once more with bitterest pain:<br>“O Lakshmaṇ every flower that lies<br>Here on the ground I recognize.<br>I culled them in the grove, and there<br>My darling twined them in her hair.<br>The sun, the earth, the genial breeze<br>Have spared these flowers my soul to please.”<br><br>  Then to that woody hill he prayed,<br>Whence flashed afar each wild cascade:<br>“O best of mountains, hast thou seen<br>A dame of perfect form and mien<br>In some sweet spot with trees o’ergrown,—<br>My darling whom I left alone?”<br>Then as a lion threats a deer<br>He thundered with a voice of fear:<br>“Reveal her, mountain, to my view<br>With golden limbs and golden hue.<br>Where is my darling Sítá? speak<br>Before I rend thee peak from peak.”<br><br>  The mountain seemed her track to show,<br>But told not all he sought to know.<br>Then Daśaratha’s son renewed<br>His summons as the mount he viewed:<br>“Soon as my flaming arrows fly,<br>Consumed to ashes shall thou lie<br>Without a herb or bud or tree,<br>And birds no more shall dwell in thee.<br>And if this stream my prayer deny,<br>My wrath this day her flood shall dry,<br>Because she lends no aid to trace<br>My darling of the lotus face.”<br><br>  Thus Ráma spake as though his ire<br>Would scorch them with his glance of fire;<br>Then searching farther on the ground<br>The footprint of a fiend he found,<br>And small light traces here and there,<br>Where Sítá in her great despair,<br>Shrieking for Ráma’s help, had fled<br>Before the giant’s mighty tread.<br>His careful eye each trace surveyed<br>Which Sítá and the fiend had made,—<br>The quivers and the broken bow<br>And ruined chariot of the foe,—<br>And told, distraught by fear and grief,<br>His tidings to his brother chief:<br>“O Lakshmaṇ, here,” he cried “behold<br>My Sítá’s earrings dropped with gold.<br>Here lie her garlands torn and rent,<br>Here lies each glittering ornament.<br>O look, the ground on every side<br>With blood-like drops of gold is dyed.<br>The fiends who wear each strange disguise<br>Have seized, I ween, the helpless prize.<br>My lady, by their hands o’erpowered,<br>Is slaughtered, mangled, and devoured.<br>Methinks two fearful giants came<br>And waged fierce battle for the dame.<br>Whose, Lakshmaṇ, was this mighty bow<br>With pearls and gems in glittering row?<br>Cast to the ground the fragments lie,<br>And still their glory charms the eye.<br>A bow so mighty sure was planned<br>For heavenly God or giant’s hand.<br>Whose was this coat of golden mail<br>Which, though its lustre now is pale,<br>Shone like the sun of morning, bright<br>With studs of glittering lazulite?<br>Whose, Lakshmaṇ, was this bloom-wreathed shade<br>With all its hundred ribs displayed?<br>This screen, most meet for royal brow,<br>With broken staff lies useless now.<br>And these tall asses, goblin-faced,<br>With plates of golden harness graced,<br>Whose hideous forms are stained with gore<br>Who is the lord whose yoke they bore?<br>Whose was this pierced and broken car<br>That shoots a flame-like blaze afar?<br>Whose these spent shafts at random spread,<br>Each fearful with its iron head,—<br>With golden mountings fair to see,<br>Long as a chariot’s axle-tree?<br>These quivers see, which, rent in twain,<br>Their sheaves of arrows still contain.<br>Whose was this driver? Dead and cold,<br>His hands the whip and reins still hold.<br>See, Lakshmaṇ, here the foot I trace<br>Of man, nay, one of giant race.<br>The hatred that I nursed of old<br>Grows mightier now a hundred fold<br>Against these giants, fierce of heart,<br>Who change their forms by magic art.<br>Slain, eaten by the giant press,<br>Or stolen is the votaress,<br>Nor could her virtue bring defence<br>To Sítá seized and hurried hence.<br>O, if my love be slain or lost<br>All hope of bliss for me is crossed.<br>The power of all the worlds were vain<br>To bring one joy to soothe my pain.<br>The spirits with their blinded eyes<br>Would look in wonder, and despise<br>The Lord who made the worlds, the great<br>Creator when compassionate.<br>And so, I ween, the Immortals turn<br>Cold eyes upon me now, and spurn<br>The weakling prompt at pity’s call,<br>Devoted to the good of all.<br>But from this day behold me changed,<br>From every gentle grace estranged.<br>Now be it mine all life to slay,<br>And sweep these cursed fiends away.<br>As the great sun leaps up the sky,<br>And the cold moonbeams fade and die,<br>So vengeance rises in my breast,<br>One passion conquering all the rest.<br>Gandharvas in their radiant place,<br>The Yakshas, and the giant race,<br>Kinnars and men shall look in vain<br>For joy they ne’er shall see again.<br>The anguish of my great despair,<br>O Lakshmaṇ, fills the heaven and air;<br>And I in wrath all life will slay<br>Within the triple world to-day.<br>Unless the Gods in heaven who dwell<br>Restore my Sítá safe and well,<br>I armed with all the fires of Fate,<br>The triple world will devastate.<br>The troubled stars from heaven shall fall,<br>The moon be wrapped in gloomy pall,<br>The fire be quenched, the wind be stilled,<br>The radiant sun grow dark and chilled;<br>Crushed every mountain’s towering pride,<br>And every lake and river dried,<br>Dead every creeper, plant, and tree,<br>And lost for aye the mighty sea.<br>Thou shalt the world this day behold<br>In wild disorder uncontrolled,<br>With dying life which naught defends<br>From the fierce storm my bowstring sends.<br>My shafts this day, for Sítá’s sake,<br>The life of every fiend shall take.<br>The Gods this day shall see the force<br>That wings my arrows on their course,<br>And mark how far that course is held,<br>By my unsparing wrath impelled.<br>No God, not one of Daitya strain,<br>Goblin or Rákshas shall remain.<br>My wrath shall end the worlds, and all<br>Demons and Gods therewith shall fall.<br>Each world which Gods, the Dánav race,<br>And giants make their dwelling place,<br>Shall fall beneath my arrows sent<br>In fury when my bow is bent.<br>The arrows loosened from my string<br>Confusion on the worlds shall bring.<br>For she is lost or breathes no more,<br>Nor will the Gods my love restore.<br>Hence all on earth with life and breath<br>This day I dedicate to death.<br>All, till my darling they reveal,<br>The fury of my shafts shall feel.”<br><br>  Thus as he spake by rage impelled,<br>Red grew his eyes, his fierce lips swelled.<br>His bark coat round his form he drew<br>And coiled his hermit braids anew,<br>Like Rudra when he yearned to slay<br>The demon Tripur<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">An Asur or demon, king of Tripura, the modern Tipperah.

</span></span> in the fray.<br>So looked the hero brave and wise,<br>The fury flashing from his eyes.<br>Then Ráma, conqueror of the foe,<br>From Lakshmaṇ’s hand received his bow,<br>Strained the great string, and laid thereon<br>A deadly dart that flashed and shone,<br>And spake these words as fierce in ire<br>As He who ends the worlds with fire:<br><br>  “As age and time and death and fate<br>All life with checkless power await,<br>So Lakshmaṇ in my wrath to-day<br>My vengeful might shall brook no stay,<br>Unless this day I see my dame<br>In whose sweet form is naught to blame,—<br>Yea, as before, my love behold<br>Fair with bright teeth and perfect mould,<br>This world shall feel a deadly blow<br>Destroyed with ruthless overthrow,<br>And serpent lords and Gods of air,<br>Gandharvas, men, the doom shall share.”
