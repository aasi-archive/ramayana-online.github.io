                            As Ráma viewed with heart-felt pain<br>The vulture whom the fiend had slain,<br>In words with tender love impressed<br>His brother chief he thus addressed:<br><br>  “This royal bird with faithful thought<br>For my advantage strove and fought.<br>Slain by the fiend in mortal strife<br>For me he yields his noble life.<br>See, Lakshmaṇ, how his wounds have bled;<br>His struggling breath will soon have fled.<br>Faint is his voice, and near to die,<br>He scarce can lift his trembling eye.<br>Jaṭáyus, if thou still can speak,<br>Give, give the answer that I seek.<br>The fate of ravished Sítá tell,<br>And how thy mournful chance befell.<br>Say why the giant stole my dame:<br>What have I done that he could blame?<br>What fault in me has Rávaṇ seen<br>That he should rob me of my queen?<br>How looked the lady’s moon-bright cheek?<br>What were the words she found to speak?<br>His strength, his might, his deeds declare:<br>And tell the form he loves to wear.<br>To all my questions make reply:<br>Where does the giant’s dwelling lie?”<br><br>  The noble bird his glances bent<br>On Ráma as he made lament,<br>And in low accents faint and weak<br>With anguish thus began to speak:<br>“Fierce Rávaṇ, king of giant race,<br>Stole Sítá from thy dwelling-place.<br>He calls his magic art to aid<br>With wind and cloud and gloomy shade.<br>When in the fight my power was spent<br>My wearied wings he cleft and rent.<br>Then round the dame his arms he threw,<br>And to the southern region flew.<br>O Raghu’s son, I gasp for breath,<br>My swimming sight is dim in death.<br>E’en now before my vision pass<br>Bright trees of gold with hair of grass,<br>The hour the impious robber chose<br>Brings on the thief a flood of woes.<br>The giant in his haste forgot<br>’Twas Vinda’s hour,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">From the root<em>&nbsp;vid</em>, to find.
