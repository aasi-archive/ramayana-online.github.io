                            The son of Raghu near the wall<br>Saw, proudly towering over all,<br>The mighty giant stride along<br>Attended by the warrior throng;<br>Heard Kumbhakarṇa’s heavy feet<br>Awake the echoes of the street;<br>And, with the lust of battle fired,<br>Turned to Vibhishaṇ and inquired:<br>“Vibhishaṇ, tell that chieftain’s name<br>Who rears so high his mountain frame;<br>With glittering helm and lion eyes,<br>Preëminent in might and size<br>Above the rest of giant birth,<br>He towers the standard of the earth;<br>And all the Vánars when they see<br>The mighty warrior turn and flee.”<br><br>  “In him,” Vibhishaṇ answered, “know<br>Viśravas’ son, the Immortals’ foe,<br>Fierce Kumbhakarṇa, mightier far<br>Than Gods and fiends and giants are.<br>He conquered Yáma in the fight,<br>And Indra trembling owned his might.<br>His arm the Gods and fiends subdued,<br>Gandharvas and the serpent brood.<br>The rest of his gigantic race<br>Are wondrous strong by God-giving grace;<br>But nature at his birth to him<br>Gave matchless power and strength of limb.<br>Scarce was he born, fierce monster, when<br>He killed and ate a thousand men.<br>The trembling race of men, appalled,<br>On Indra for protection called;<br>And he, to save the suffering world,<br>His bolt at Kumbhakarṇa hurled.<br>So awful was the monster’s yell<br>That fear on all the nations fell,<br>He, rushing on with furious roar,<br>A tusk from huge Airávat tore,<br>And dealt the God so dire a blow<br>That Indra reeling left his foe,<br>And with the Gods and mortals fled<br>To Brahmá’s throne dispirited.<br>“O Brahmá,” thus the suppliants cried,<br>“Some refuge for this woe provide.<br>If thus his maw the giant sate<br>Soon will the world be desolate.”<br>The Self-existent calmed their woe,<br>And spake in anger to their foe:<br>“As thou wast born, Pulastya’s son,<br>That worlds might weep by thee undone,<br>Thou like the dead henceforth shalt be:<br>Such is the curse I lay on thee.”<br>Senseless he lay, nor spoke nor stirred;<br>Such was the power of Brahmá’s word.<br>But Rávaṇ, troubled for his sake,<br>Thus to the Self-existent spake:<br>“Who lops the tree his care has reared<br>When golden fruit has first appeared?<br>Not thus, O Brahmá, deal with one<br>Descended from thine own dear son.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Pulastya was the son of Brahmá and father of Viśravas or Paulastya
