                            The giant viewed with earnest ken<br>The Vánars and the lords of men;<br>Then thus, with grief and anger moved,<br>In bitter tone the spies reproved:<br>“Can faithful servants hope to please<br>Their master with such fates as these?<br>Or hope ye with wild words to wring<br>The bosom of your lord and king?<br>Such words were better said by those<br>Who come arrayed our mortal foes.<br>In vain your ears have heard the sage,<br>And listened to the lore of age,<br>Untaught, though lectured many a day,<br>The first great lesson, to obey,<br>’Tis marvel Rávaṇ reigns and rules<br>Whose counsellors are blind and fools.<br>Has death no terrors that ye dare<br>To tempt your monarch to despair,<br>From whose imperial mandate flow<br>Disgrace and honour, weal and woe?<br>Yea, forest trees, when flames are fanned<br>About their scorching trunks, may stand;<br>But naught can set the sinner free<br>When kings the punishment decree.<br>I would not in mine anger spare<br>The traitorous foe-praising pair,<br>But years of faithful service plead<br>For pardon, and they shall not bleed.<br>Henceforth to me be dead: depart,<br>Far from my presence and my heart.”<br><br>  Thus spoke the angry king: the two<br>Cried, Long live Rávaṇ, and withdrew,<br>The giant monarch turned and cried<br>To strong Mahodar at his side:<br>“Go thou, and spies more faithful bring.<br>More duteous to their lord the king.”<br><br>  Swift at his word Mahodar shed,<br>And came returning at the head<br>Of long tried messengers, who bent<br>Before their monarch reverent.<br>“Go quickly hence,” said Rávaṇ “scan<br>With keenest eyes the foeman’s plan.<br>Learn who, as nearest friends, advise<br>And mould each secret enterprise.<br>Learn when he wakes and goes to rest,<br>Sound every purpose of his breast.<br>Learn what the prince intends to-day:<br>Watch keenly all, and come away.”<br><br>  With joy they heard the words he said:<br>Then with Śárdúla at their head<br>About the giant king they went<br>With circling paces reverent.<br>By fair Suvela’s grassy side<br>The chiefs of Raghu’s race they spied,<br>Where, shaded by the waving wood,<br>Vibhishaṇ and Sugríva stood.<br>A while they rested there and viewed<br>The Vánars’ countless multitude.<br>Vibhishaṇ with observant eyes<br>Knew at a glance the giant spies,<br>And bade the warriors of his train<br>Bind the rash foes with cord and chain:<br>“Śárdúla’s is the sin,” he cried.<br>He neath the Vánars’ hands had died,<br>But Ráma from their fury freed<br>The captive in his utmost need,<br>And, merciful at sight of woe,<br>Loosed all the spies and bade them go.<br>Then home to Lanká’s monarch fled<br>The giant chiefs discomfited.
