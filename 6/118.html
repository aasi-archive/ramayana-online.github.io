                            Struck down with overwhelming shame<br>She shrank within her trembling frame.<br>Each word of Ráma’s like a dart<br>Had pierced the lady to the heart;<br>And from her sweet eyes unrestrained<br>The torrent of her sorrows, rained.<br>Her weeping eyes at length she dried,<br>And thus mid choking sobs replied:<br>“Canst thou, a high-born prince, dismiss<br>A high-born dame with speech like this?<br>Such words befit the meanest hind,<br>Not princely birth and generous mind,<br>By all my virtuous life I swear<br>I am not what thy words declare.<br>If some are faithless, wilt thou find<br>No love and truth in womankind?<br>Doubt others if thou wilt, but own<br>The truth which all my life has shown.<br>If, when the giant seized his prey,<br>Within his hated arms I lay,<br>And felt the grasp I dreaded, blame<br>Fate and the robber, not thy dame.<br>What could a helpless woman do?<br>My heart was mine and still was true,<br>Why when Hanúmán sent by thee<br>Sought Lanká’s town across the sea,<br>Couldst thou not give, O lord of men,<br>Thy sentence of rejection then?<br>Then in the presence of the chief<br>Death, ready death, had brought relief,<br>Nor had I nursed in woe and pain<br>This lingering life, alas in vain.<br>Then hadst thou shunned the fruitless strife<br>Nor jeopardied thy noble life,<br>But spared thy friends and bold allies<br>Their vain and weary enterprise.<br>Is all forgotten, all? my birth,<br>Named Janak’s child, from fostering earth?<br>That day of triumph when a maid<br>My trembling hand in thine I laid?<br>My meek obedience to thy will,<br>My faithful love through joy and ill,<br>That never failed at duty’s call—<br>O King, is all forgotten, all?”<br><br>  To Lakshmaṇ then she turned and spoke<br>While sobs and sighs her utterance broke:<br>“Sumitrá’s son, a pile prepare,<br>My refuge in my dark despair.<br>I will not live to bear this weight<br>Of shame, forlorn and desolate.<br>The kindled fire my woes shall end<br>And be my best and surest friend.”<br><br>  His mournful eyes the hero raised<br>And wistfully on Ráma gazed,<br>In whose stern look no ruth was seen,<br>No mercy for the weeping queen.<br>No chieftain dared to meet those eyes,<br>To pray, to question or advise.<br><br>  The word was passed, the wood was piled<br>And fain to die stood Janak’s child.<br>She slowly paced around her lord,<br>The Gods with reverent act adored,<br>Then raising suppliant hands the dame<br>Prayed humbly to the Lord of Flame:<br>“As this fond heart by virtue swayed<br>From Raghu’s son has never strayed,<br>So, universal witness, Fire<br>Protect my body on the pyre,<br>As Raghu’s son has idly laid<br>This charge on Sítá, hear and aid.”<br><br>  She ceased: and fearless to the last<br>Within the flame’s wild fury passed.<br>Then rose a piercing cry from all<br>Dames, children, men, who saw her fall<br>Adorned with gems and gay attire<br>Beneath the fury of the fire.
