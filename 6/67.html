commonplace epithets and similes and other unimportant matter. There
are many verses in this Canto which European scholars would rigidly
exclude as unmistakeably the work of later rhapsodists. Even the
reverent Commentator whom I follow ventures to remark once or twice:<em>&nbsp;Ayam śloka prak shipta iti bahavah</em>, “This<em>&nbsp;śloka</em> or verse is in
the opinion of many interpolated.”
