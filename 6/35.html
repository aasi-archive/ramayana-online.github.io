                            The fearful notes of drum and shell<br>Upon the ear of Rávaṇ fell.<br>One moment quailed his haughty look,<br>One moment in his fear he shook,<br>But soon recalling wonted pride,<br>His counsellors he sternly eyed,<br>And with a voice that thundered through<br>The council hall began anew:<br>“Lords, I have heard—your tongues have told—<br>How Raghu’s son is fierce and bold.<br>To Lanká’s shore has bridged his way<br>And hither leads his wild array.<br>I know your might, in battle tried,<br>Fighting and conquering by my side.<br>Why now, when such a foe is near,<br>Looks eye to eye in silent fear?”<br><br>  He ceased, his mother’s sire well known<br>For wisdom in the council shown,<br>Malyaván, sage and faithful guide.<br>Thus to the monarch’s speech replied:<br>“Long reigns the king in safe repose,<br>Unmoved by fear of vanquished foes,<br>Whose feet by saving knowledge led<br>In justice path delight to tread:<br>Who knows to sheath the sword or wield,<br>To order peace, to strike or yield:<br>Prefers, when foes are stronger, peace,<br>And bids a doubtful conflict cease.<br>Now, King, the choice before thee lies,<br>Make peace with Ráma, and be wise.<br>This day the captive queen restore<br>Who brings the foe to Lanká’s shore.<br>The Sire by whom the worlds are swayed<br>Of yore the Gods and demons made.<br>With these Injustice sided; those<br>Fair Justice for her champions chose.<br>Still Justice dwells with Gods above;<br>Injustice, fiends and giants love.<br>Thou, through the worlds that fear thee, long<br>Hast scorned the right and loved the wrong,<br>And Justice, with thy foes allied,<br>Gives might resistless to their side.<br>Thou, guided by thy wicked will,<br>Hast found delight in deeds of ill,<br>And sages in their holy rest<br>Have trembled, by thy power oppressed.<br>But they, who check each vain desire,<br>Are clothed with might which burns like fire.<br>In them the power and glory live<br>Which zeal and saintly fervour give.<br>Their constant task, their sole delight<br>Is worship and each holy rite,<br>To chant aloud the Veda hymn,<br>Nor let the sacred fires grow dim.<br>Now through the air like thunder ring<br>The echoes of the chants they sing.<br>The vapours of their incense rise<br>And veil with cloudy pall the skies,<br>And Rákshas might grows weak and faint<br>Killed by the power of sage and saint.<br>By Brahmá’s boon thy life was screened<br>From God, Gandharva, Yaksha, fiend;<br>But Vánars, men, and bears, arrayed<br>Against thee now, thy shores invade.<br>Red meteors, heralds of despair<br>Flash frequent through the lurid air,<br>Foretelling to my troubled mind<br>The ruin of the Rákshas kind.<br>With awful thundering overhead<br>Clouds black as night are densely spread,<br>And oozing from the gloomy pall<br>Great drops of blood on Lanká fall.<br>Dogs roam through house and shrine to steal<br>The sacred oil and curd and meal,<br>Cats pair with tigers, hounds with swine,<br>And asses’ foals are born of kine.<br>In these and countless signs I trace<br>The ruin of the giant race.<br>’Tis Vishṇu’s self who comes to storm<br>Thy city, clothed in Ráma’s form;<br>For, well I ween, no mortal hand<br>The ocean with a bridge has spanned.<br>O giant King, the dame release,<br>And sue to Raghu’s son for peace”
