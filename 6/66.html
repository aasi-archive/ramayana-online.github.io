                            In pomp and pride of warlike state<br>The giant passed the city gate.<br>He raised his voice: the hills, the shore<br>Of Lanká’s sea returned the roar.<br>The Vánars saw the chief draw nigh<br>Whom not the ruler of the sky,<br>Nor Yáma, monarch of the dead,<br>Might vanquish, and affrighted fled.<br>When royal Angad, Báli’s son,<br>Saw the scared Vánars turn and run,<br>Undaunted still he kept his ground,<br>And shouted as he gazed around:<br>“O Nala, Níla, stay nor let<br>Your souls your generous worth forget,<br>O Kumud and Gaváksha, why<br>Like base-born Vánars will ye fly?<br>Turn, turn, nor shame your order thus:<br>This giant is no match for us”<br><br>  They heard his voice: the flight was stayed;<br>Again for war they stood arrayed,<br>And hurled upon the foe a shower<br>Of mountain peaks and trees in flower.<br>Still on his limbs their missiles rained:<br>Unmoved, their blows he still sustained,<br>And seemed unconscious of the stroke<br>When rocks against his body broke.<br>Fierce as the flame when woods are dry<br>He charged with fury in his eye.<br>Like trees consumed with fervent heat<br>They fell beneath the giant’s feet.<br>Some o’er the ground, dyed red with gore,<br>Fled wild with terror to the shore,<br>And, deeming that all hope was lost,<br>Ran to the bridge they erst had crossed.<br>Some clomb the trees their lives to save,<br>Some sought the mountain and the cave;<br>Some hid them in the bosky dell,<br>And there in deathlike slumber fell.<br><br>  When Angad saw the chieftains fly<br>He called them with a mighty cry:<br>“Once more, O Vánars, charge once more,<br>On to the battle as before.<br>In all her compass earth has not,<br>To hide you safe, one secret spot.<br>What! leave your arms? each nobler dame<br>Will scorn her consort for the shame.<br>This blot upon your names efface,<br>And keep your valour from disgrace.<br>Stay, chieftains; wherefore will ye run,<br>A band of warriors scared by one?”<br><br>  Scarce would they hear: they would not stay,<br>And basely spoke in wild dismay:<br>“Have we not fought, and fought in vain<br>Have we not seen our mightiest slain?<br>The giant’s matchless force we fear,<br>And fly because our lives are dear.”<br>But Báli’s son with gentle art<br>Dispelled their dread and cheered each heart.<br>They turned and formed and waited still<br>Obedient to the prince’s will.
