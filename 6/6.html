                            But when the giant king surveyed<br>His glorious town in ruin laid,<br>And each dire sign of victory won<br>By Hanumán the Wind-God’s son,<br>He vailed his angry eyes oppressed<br>By shame, and thus his lords addressed:<br>“The Vánar spy has passed the gate<br>Of Lanká long inviolate,<br>Eluded watch and ward, and seen<br>With his bold eyes the captive queen.<br>My royal roof with flames is red,<br>The bravest of my lords are dead,<br>And the fierce Vánar in his hate<br>Has left our city desolate.<br>Now ponder well the work that lies<br>Before us, ponder and advise.<br>With deep-observing judgment scan<br>The peril, and mature a plan.<br>From counsel, sages say, the root,<br>Springs victory, most glorious fruit.<br>First ranks the king, when woe impends<br>Who seeks the counsel of his friends,<br>Of kinsmen ever faithful found,<br>Or those whose hopes with his are bound,<br>Then with their aid his strength applies,<br>And triumphs in his enterprise.<br>Next ranks the prince who plans alone,<br>No counsel seeks to aid his own,<br>Weighs loss and gain and wrong and right,<br>And seeks success with earnest might.<br>Unwisest he who spurns delays,<br>Who counts no cost, no peril weighs,<br>Speeds to his aim, defying fate,<br>And risks his all, precipitate.<br>Thus too in counsel sages find<br>A best, a worst, a middle kind.<br>When gathered counsellors explore<br>The way by light of holy lore,<br>And all from first to last agree,<br>Is the best counsel of the three.<br>Next, if debate first waxes high,<br>And each his chosen plan would try<br>Till all agree at last, we deem<br>This counsel second in esteem.<br>Worst of the three is this, when each<br>Assails with taunt his fellow’s speech;<br>When all debate, and no consent<br>Concludes the angry argument.<br>Consult then, lords; my task shall be<br>To crown with act your wise decree.<br>With thousands of his wild allies<br>The vengeful Ráma hither hies;<br>With unresisted might and speed<br>Across the flood his troops will lead,<br>Or for the Vánar host will drain<br>The channels of the conquered main.”
