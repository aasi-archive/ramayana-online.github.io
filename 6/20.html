                            Śárdúla, Rávaṇ’s spy, surveyed<br>The legions on the strand arrayed.<br>And bore, his bosom racked with fear,<br>These tidings to the monarch’s ear:<br><br>  “They come, they come. A rushing tide,<br>Ten leagues they spread from side to side,<br>And on to storm thy city press,<br>Fierce rovers of the wilderness.<br>Rich in each princely power and grace,<br>The pride of Daśaratha’s race,<br>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ lead their bands,<br>And halt them on the ocean sands.<br>O Monarch, rise, this peril meet;<br>Risk not the danger of defeat.<br>First let each wiser art be tried;<br>Bribe them, or win them, or divide.”<br>Such was the counsel of the spy:<br>And Rávaṇ called to Śuka: “Fly,<br>Sugríva lord of Vánars seek,<br>And thus my kingly message speak:<br>“Great power and might and fame are thine,<br>Brave scion of a royal line,<br>King Riksharajas’ son, in thee<br>A brother and a friend I see.<br>How wronged by me canst thou complain?<br>What profit here pretend to gain?<br>If from the wood the wife I stole<br>Of Ráma of the prudent soul,<br>What cause hast thou to mourn the theft?<br>Thou art not injured or bereft.<br>Return, O King, thy steps retrace<br>And seek thy mountain dwelling-place.<br>No, never may thy hosts within<br>My Lanká’s walls a footing win.<br>A mighty town whose strength defies<br>The gathered armies of the skies.”<br><br>  He ceased: obedient Śuka heard;<br>With wings and plumage of a bird<br>He rose in eager speed and through<br>The air upon his errand flew.<br>Borne o’er the sea with rapid wing<br>He stood above the Vánar king,<br>And spoke aloud, sublime in air,<br>The message he was charged to bear.<br>The Vánar heard the words he spoke,<br>And quick redoubling stroke on stroke<br>On head and pinions hemmed him round<br>And bore him struggling to the ground.<br>The Rákshas wounded and distressed<br>These words to Raghu’s son addressed:<br><br>  “Quick, quick! This Vánar host restrain,<br>For heralds never must be slain.<br>To him alone, a wretch untrue,<br>The punishment of death is due<br>Who leaves his master’s speech unsaid<br>And speaks another in its stead.”<br>Moved by the suppliant speech and prayer<br>Up sprang the prince and cried, forbear.<br>Saved from his wild assailant’s blows<br>Again the Rákshas herald rose<br>And borne on light wings to the sky<br>Addressed Sugríva from on high:<br>“O Vánar Monarch, chief endued<br>With power and wonderous fortitude,<br>What answer is my king, the fear<br>And scourge of weeping worlds, to hear?”<br>“Go tell thy lord,” Sugríva cried,<br>“Thou, Ráma’s foe, art thus defied.<br>His arm the guilty Báli slew;<br>Thus, tyrant, shalt thou perish too.<br>Thy sons, thy friends, proud King, and all<br>Thy kith and kin with thee shall fall;<br>And, emptied of the giant’s brood,<br>Burnt Lanká be a solitude.<br>Fly to the Sun-God’s pathway, go<br>And hide thee deep in hell below:<br>In vain from Ráma shalt thou flee<br>Though heavenly warriors fight for thee.<br>Thine arm subdued, securely bold,<br>The Vulture-king infirm and old:<br>But will thy puny strength avail<br>When Raghu’s wrathful sons assail?<br>A captive in thy palace lies<br>The lady of the lotus eyes:<br>Thou knowest not how fierce and strong<br>Is he whom thou hast dared to wrong.<br>The best of Raghu’s lineage, he<br>Whose conquering hand shall punish thee.”<br><br>  He ceased: and Angad raised a cry;<br>“This is no herald but a spy.<br>Above thee from his airy post<br>His rapid eye surveyed our host,<br>Where with advantage he might scan<br>Our gathered strength from rear to van.<br>Bind him, Vánars, bind the spy,<br>Nor let him back to Lanká fly.”<br><br>  They hurled the Rákshas to the ground,<br>They grasped his neck, his pinions bound,<br>And firmly held him while in vain<br>His voice was lifted to complain.<br>But Ráma’s heart inclined to spare,<br>He listened to his plaint and prayer,<br>And cried aloud: “O Vánars, cease;<br>The captive from his bonds release.”
