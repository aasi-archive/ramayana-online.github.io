                            But haughty Kumbhakarṇa spurned<br>His counsel, and to Rávaṇ turned:<br>“Thy life from peril will I free<br>And slay the foe who threatens thee.<br>A hero never vaunts in vain,<br>Like bellowing clouds devoid of rain,<br>Nor, Monarch, be thine ear inclined<br>To counsellors of slavish kind,<br>Who with mean arts their king mislead<br>And mar each gallant plan and deed.<br>O, let not words like his beguile<br>The glorious king of Lanká’s isle.”<br><br>  Thus scornful Kumbhakarṇa cried,<br>And Rávaṇ with a laugh replied:<br>“Mahodar fears and fain would shun<br>The battle with Ikshváku’s son.<br>Of all my giant warriors, who<br>Is strong as thou, and brave and true?<br>Ride, conqueror, to the battle ride,<br>And tame the foeman’s senseless pride.<br>Go forth like Yáma to the field,<br>And let thine arm thy trident wield.<br>Scared by the lightning of thine eye<br>The Vánar hosts will turn and fly;<br>And Ráma, when he sees thee near,<br>With trembling heart will own his fear.”<br><br>  The champion heard, and, well content,<br>Forth from the hall his footsteps bent.<br>He grasped his spear, the foeman’s dread,<br>Black iron all, both shaft and head,<br>Which, dyed in many a battle, bore<br>Great spots of slaughtered victims’ gore.<br>The king upon his neck had thrown<br>The jewelled chain which graced his own.<br>And garlands of delicious scent<br>About his limbs for ornament.<br>Around his arms gay bracelets clung,<br>And pendants in his ears were hung.<br>Adorned with gold, about his waist<br>His coat of mail was firmly braced,<br>And like Náráyaṇ<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">A name of Vishṇu.

</span></span> or the God<br>Who rules the sky he proudly trod.<br>Behind him went a mighty throng<br>Of giant warriors tall and strong,<br>On elephants of noblest breeds.<br>With cars, with camels, and with steeds:<br>And, armed with spear and axe and sword<br>Were fain to battle for their lord.<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">There is so much commonplace repetition in these Sallies of the
Rákshas chieftains that omissions are frequently necessary. The
usual ill omens attend the sally of Kumbhakarṇa, and the Canto ends
with a description of the terrified Vánars’ flight which is briefly
repeated in different words at the beginning of the next Canto.
