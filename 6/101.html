                            When Rávaṇ saw his darts repelled,<br>With double rage his bosom swelled.<br>He summoned, wroth but undismayed,<br>A mightier charm to lend its aid.<br>And, fierce as fire before the blast,<br>A storm of missiles thick and fast,<br>Spear, pike and javelin, mace and brand,<br>Came hurtling from the giant’s hand.<br>But, mightier still, the arms employed<br>By Raghu’s son their force destroyed,<br>And every dart fell dulled and spent<br>By powers the bards of heaven had lent.<br>With his huge mace Vibhishaṇ slew<br>The steeds that Rávaṇ’s chariot drew.<br>Then Rávaṇ hurled in deadly ire<br>A ponderous spear that flashed like fire:<br>But Ráma’s arrows checked its way,<br>And harmless on the earth it lay,<br>The giant seized a mightier spear,<br>Which Death himself would shun with fear.<br>Vibhishaṇ with the stroke had died,<br>But Lakshmaṇ’s hand his bowstring plied,<br>And flying arrows thick as hail<br>Smote fiercely on the giant’s mail.<br>Then Rávaṇ turned his aim aside,<br>On Lakshmaṇ looked and fiercely cried:<br>“Thou, thou again my wrath hast braved,<br>And from his death Vibhishaṇ saved.<br>Now in his stead this spear receive<br>Whose deadly point thy heart shall cleave.”<br><br>  He ceased: he hurled the mortal dart<br>By Maya forged with magic art.<br>The spear, with all his fury flung,<br>Swift, flickering like a serpent’s tongue,<br>Adorned with many a tinkling bell,<br>Smote Lakshmaṇ, and the hero fell.<br>When Ráma saw, he heaved a sigh,<br>A tear one moment dimmed his eye.<br>But tender grief was soon repressed<br>And thoughts of vengeance filled his breast.<br>The air around him flashed and gleamed<br>As from his bow the arrows streamed;<br>And Lanká’s lord, the foeman’s dread,<br>O’erwhelmed with terror turned and fled.
