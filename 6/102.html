                            But Ráma, pride of Raghu’s race,<br>Gazed tenderly on Lakshmaṇ’s face,<br>And, as the sight his spirit broke,<br>Turned to Susheṇ and sadly spoke:<br>“Where is my power and valour? how<br>Shall I have heart for battle now,<br>When dead before my weeping eyes<br>My brother, noblest Lakshmaṇ, lies?<br>My tears in blinding torrents flow,<br>My hand unnerved has dropped my bow.<br>The pangs of woe have blanched my cheek,<br>My heart is sick, my strength is weak.<br>Ah me, my brother! Ah, that I<br>By Lakshmaṇ’s side might sink and die:<br>Life, war and conquest, all are vain<br>If Lakshmaṇ lies in battle slain.<br>Why will those eyes my glances shun?<br>Hast thou no word of answer, none?<br>Ah, is thy noble spirit flown<br>And gone to other worlds alone?<br>Couldst thou not let thy brother seek<br>Those worlds with thee? O speak, O speak!<br>Rise up once more, my brother, rise,<br>Look on me with thy loving eyes.<br>Were not thy steps beside me still<br>In gloomy wood, on breezy hill?<br>Did not thy gentle care assuage<br>Thy brother’s grief and fitful rage?<br>Didst thou not all his troubles share,<br>His guide and comfort in despair?”<br><br>  As Ráma, vanquished, wept and sighed<br>The Vánar chieftain thus replied:<br>“Great Prince, unmanly thoughts dismiss,<br>Nor yield thy soul to grief like this.<br>In vain those burning tears are shed:<br>Our glory Lakshmaṇ is not dead.<br>Death on his brow no mark has set,<br>Where beauty’s lustre lingers yet.<br>Clear is the skin, and tender hues<br>Of lotus flowers his palms suffuse.<br>O Ráma, cheer thy trembling heart;<br>Not thus do life and body part.<br>Now, Hanumán, to thee I speak:<br>Hie hence to tall Mahodaya’s<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Apparently a peak of the Himalaya chain.

Bengal recension (Gortesio’s text). Among other adventures he
narrowly escapes being shot by Bharat as he passes over Nandigrama
near Ayodhyá. Hanumán stays Bharat in time, and gives him an account
of what has befallen Ráma and Sítá in the forest and in Lanká.

</span></span><br>Susheṇ in wonder viewed the hill,<br>And culled the sovereign salve of ill.<br>Soon as the healing herb he found,<br>The fragrant leaves he crushed and ground.<br>Then over Lakshmaṇ’s face he bent,<br>Who, healed and strengthened by the scent<br>Of that blest herb divinely sweet,<br>Rose fresh and lusty on his feet.
