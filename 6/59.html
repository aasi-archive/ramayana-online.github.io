whither wilt thou fly, and how<br>Escape the death that waits thee now?”<br><br>  No word the giant king returned:<br>His eyes with flames of fury burned.<br>His arm was stretched, his bow was bent,<br>And swift his fiery shafts were sent.<br>Red torrents from the Vánar flowed:<br>Then Ráma near to Rávaṇ strode,<br>And with keen darts that never failed,<br>The chariot of the king assailed.<br>With surest aim his arrows flew:<br>The driver and the steeds he slew.<br>And shattered with the pointed steel<br>Car, flag, and pole and yoke and wheel.<br>As Indra hurls his bolt to smite<br>Mount Meru’s heaven-ascending height,<br>So Ráma with a flaming dart<br>Struck Lanká’s monarch near the heart,<br>Who reeled and fell beneath the blow<br>And from loose fingers dropped his bow.<br>Bright as the sun, with crescent head,<br>From Ráma’s bow an arrow sped,<br>And from his forehead, proud no more,<br>Cleft the bright coronet he wore.<br>Then Ráma stood by Rávaṇ’s side<br>And to the conquered giant cried:<br>“Well hast thou fought: thine arm has slain<br>Strong heroes of the Vánar train.<br>I will not strike or slay thee now,<br>For weary, faint with fight art thou.<br>To Lanká’s town thy footsteps bend,<br>And there the night securely spend.<br>To-morrow come with car and bow,<br>And then my prowess shalt thou know.”<br><br>  He ceased: the king in humbled pride<br>Rose from the earth and naught replied.<br>With wounded limbs and shattered crown<br>He sought again his royal town.
