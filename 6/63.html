                            Then Kumbhakarṇa laughed aloud<br>And cried; “O Monarch, once so proud,<br>We warned thee, but thou wouldst not hear;<br>And now the fruits of sin appear.<br>We warned thee, I, thy nobles, all<br>Who loved thee, in thy council hall.<br>Those sovereigns who with blinded eyes<br>Neglect the foe their hearts despise,<br>Soon, falling from their high estate<br>Bring on themselves the stroke of fate.<br>Accept at length, thy life to save,<br>The counsel sage Vibhishaṇ gave,<br>The prudent counsel spurned before,<br>And Sítá to her lord restore.”<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">I omit a tedious sermon on the danger of rashness and the advantages
of prudence, sufficient to irritate a less passionate hearer than
Rávaṇ.

and makes him say that Nárad the messenger of the Gods had formerly
told him that Vishṇu himself incarnate as Daśaratha’s son should
come to destroy Rávaṇ.
