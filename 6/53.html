                            When Rávaṇ in his palace heard<br>The mournful news, his wrath was stirred;<br>And, gasping like a furious snake,<br>To Vajradanshṭra thus he spake:<br><br>  “Go forth, my fiercest captain, lead<br>The bravest of the giants’ breed.<br>Go forth, the sons of Raghu slay<br>And by their side Sugríva lay.”<br><br>  He ceased: the chieftain bowed his head<br>And forth with gathered troops he sped.<br>Cars, camels, steeds were well arrayed,<br>And coloured banners o’er them played.<br>Rings decked his arms: about his waist<br>The life-protecting mail was braced,<br>And on the chieftain’s forehead set<br>Glittered his cap and coronet.<br>Borne on a bannered car that glowed<br>With golden sheen the warrior rode,<br>And footmen marched with spear and sword<br>And bow and mace behind their lord.<br>In pomp and pride of warlike state<br>They sallied from the southern gate,<br>But saw, as on their way they sped,<br>Dread signs around and overhead.<br>For there were meteors falling fast,<br>Though not a cloud its shadow cast;<br>And each ill-omened bird and beast,<br>Forboding death, the fear increased,<br>While many a giant slipped and reeled,<br>Falling before he reached the field.<br>They met in mortal strife engaged,<br>And long and fierce the battle raged.<br>Spears, swords uplifted, gleamed and flashed,<br>And many a chief to earth was dashed.<br>A ceaseless storm of arrows rained,<br>And limbs were pierced and blood-distained.<br>Terrific was the sound that filled<br>The air, and every heart was chilled,<br>As hurtling o’er the giants flew<br>The rocks and trees which Vánars threw.<br>Fierce as a hungry lion when<br>Unwary deer approach his den,<br>Angad, his eyes with fury red,<br>Waving a tree above his head,<br>Rushed with wild charge which none could stay<br>Where stood the giants’ dense array.<br>Like tall trees levelled by the blast<br>Before him fell the giants fast,<br>And earth that streamed with blood was strown<br>With warriors, steeds, and cars o’erthrown.
