                            Ranged round the spot where Ráma fell<br>Each Vánar chief stood sentinel.<br>At length the mighty hero broke<br>The trance that held him, and awoke.<br>He saw his senseless brother, dyed<br>With blood from head to foot, and cried:<br>“What have I now to do with life<br>Or rescue of my prisoned wife,<br>When thus before my weeping eyes,<br>Slain in the fight, my brother lies?<br>A queen like Sítá I may find<br>Among the best of womankind,<br>But never such a brother, tried<br>In war, my guardian, friend, and guide.<br>If he be dead, the brave and true,<br>I will not live but perish too.<br>How, reft of Lakshmaṇ, shall I meet<br>My mother, and Kaikeyí greet?<br>My brother’s eager question brook,<br>And fond Sumitrá’s longing look?<br>What shall I say, o’erwhelmed with shame<br>To cheer the miserable dame?<br>How, when she hears her son is dead,<br>Will her sad heart be comforted?<br>Ah me, for longer life unfit<br>This mortal body will I quit;<br>For Lakshmaṇ slaughtered for my sake,<br>From sleep of death will never wake.<br>Ah when I sank oppressed with care,<br>Thy gentle voice could soothe despair.<br>And art thou, O my brother, killed?<br>Is that dear voice for ever stilled?<br>Cold are those lips, my brother, whence<br>Came never word to breed offence?<br>Ah stretched upon the gory plain<br>My brother lies untimely slain:<br>Numbed is the mighty arm that slew<br>The leaders of the giant crew.<br>Transfixed with shafts, with blood-streams red,<br>Thou liest on thy lowly bed:<br>So sinks to rest, his journey done,<br>Mid arrowy rays the crimson sun.<br>Thou, when from home and sire I fled,<br>The wood’s wild ways with me wouldst tread:<br>Now close to thine my steps shall be,<br>For I in death will follow thee.<br>Vibhishaṇ now will curse my name,<br>And Ráma as a braggart blame,<br>Who promised—but his word is vain—<br>That he in Lanká’s isle should reign.<br>Return, Sugríva: reft of me<br>Lead back thy Vánars o’er the sea,<br>Nor hope to battle face to face<br>With him who rules the giant race.<br>Well have ye done and nobly fought,<br>And death in desperate combat sought.<br>All that heroic might can do,<br>Brave Vánars, has been done by you.<br>My faithful friends I now dismiss:<br>Return: my last farewell is this.”<br><br>  Bedewed with tears was every cheek<br>As thus the Vánars heard him speak.<br>Vibhishaṇ on the field had stayed<br>The Vánar hosts who fled dismayed.<br>Now lifting up his mace on high<br>With martial step the chief drew nigh.<br>The hosts who watched by Ráma’s side<br>Beheld his shape and giant stride.<br>’Tis he, ’tis Rávaṇ’s son, they thought:<br>And all in flight their safety sought.
