                            Again her eyes with tears o’erflowed:<br>She gazed upon the head he showed,<br>Gazed on the bow so famed of yore,<br>The glorious bow which Ráma bore.<br>She gazed upon his cheek and brows,<br>The eyes of her beloved spouse;<br>His lips, the lustre of his hair,<br>The priceless gem that glittered there.<br>The features of her lord she knew,<br>And, pierced with anguish at the view,<br>She lifted up her voice and cried:<br>“Kaikeyí, art thou satisfied?<br>Now all thy longings are fulfilled;<br>The joy of Raghu’s race is killed,<br>And ruined is the ancient line,<br>Destroyer, by that fraud of thine.<br>Ah, what offence, O cruel dame,<br>What fault in Ráma couldst thou blame,<br>To drive him clad in hermit dress<br>With Sítá to the wilderness?”<br><br>  Great trembling seized her frame, and she<br>Fell like a stricken plantain tree.<br>As lie the dead she lay; at length<br>Slowly regaining sense and strength,<br>On the dear head she fixed her eye<br>And cried with very bitter cry:<br>“Ah, when thy cold dead cheek I view,<br>My hero, I am murdered too.<br>Then first a faithful woman’s eyes<br>See sorrow, when her husband dies.<br>When thou, my lord, wast nigh to save,<br>Some stealthy hand thy death wound gave.<br>Thou art not dead: rise, hero, rise;<br>Long life was thine, as spake the wise<br>Whose words, I ween, are ever true,<br>For faith lies open to their view.<br>Ah lord, and shall thy head recline<br>On earth’s cold breast, forsaking mine,<br>Counting her chill lap dearer far<br>Than I and my caresses are?<br>Ah, is it thus these eyes behold<br>Thy famous bow adorned with gold,<br>Whereon of yore I loved to bind<br>Sweet garlands that my hands had twined?<br>And hast thou sought in heaven a place<br>Amid the founders of thy race,<br>Where in the home deserved so well<br>Thy sires and Daśaratha dwell?<br>Or dost thou shine a brighter star<br>In skies where blest immortals are,<br>Forsaking in thy lofty scorn<br>The race wherein thy sires were born?<br>Turn to my gaze, O turn thine eye:<br>Why are thy cold lips silent, why?<br>When first we met as youth and maid,<br>When in thy hand my hand was laid,<br>Thy promise was thy steps should be<br>Through life in duty’s path with me.<br>Remember, faithful still, thy vow,<br>And take me with thee even now.<br>Is that broad bosom where I hung,<br>That neck to which I fondly clung,<br>Where flowery garlands breathed their scent<br>By hungry dogs and vultures rent?<br>Shall no funereal honours grace<br>The parted lord of Raghu’s race,<br>Whose bounty liberal fees bestowed,<br>For whom the fires of worship glowed?<br>Kauśalyá wild with grief will see<br>One sole survivor of the three<br>Who in their hermit garments went<br>To the dark woods in banishment.<br>Then at her cry shall Lakshmaṇ tell<br>How, slain by night, the Vánars fell;<br>How to thy side the giants crept,<br>And slew the hero as he slept.<br>Thy fate and mine the queen will know,<br>And broken-hearted die of woe.<br>For my unworthy sake, for mine,<br>Ráma, the glory of his line,<br>Who bridged his way across the main,<br>Is basely in a puddle slain;<br>And I, the graceless wife he wed,<br>Have brought this ruin on his head.<br>Me, too, on him, O Rávaṇ, slay:<br>The wife beside her husband lay.<br>By his dear body let me rest,<br>Cheek close to cheek and breast to breast,<br>My happy eyes I then will close,<br>And follow whither Ráma goes.”<br><br>  Thus cried the miserable dame;<br>When to the king a warder came,<br>Before the giant monarch bowed<br>And said that, followed by a crowd<br>Of counsellors and lords of state,<br>Prahasta stood before the gate,<br>And, sent by some engrossing care,<br>Craved audience of his master there.<br>The anxious tyrant left his seat<br>And hastened forth the chief to meet:<br>Then summoning his nobles all,<br>Took counsel in his regal hall.<br><br>  When Lanká’s lord had left the queen,<br>The head and bow no more were seen.<br>The giant king his nobles eyed,<br>And, terrible as Yáma, cried:<br>“O faithful lords, the time is come:<br>Gather our hosts with beat of drum.<br>Nigh to the town our foeman draws:<br>Be prudent, nor reveal the cause.”<br><br>  The nobles listened and obeyed:<br>Swift were the gathered troops arrayed,<br>And countless rovers of the night<br>Stood burning for the hour of fight.
