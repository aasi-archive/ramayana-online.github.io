                            As shine the heavens with autumn’s moon<br>Refulgent in the height of noon,<br>So shone with light which Ráma gave<br>That army of the bold and brave,<br>As from the sea it marched away<br>In war’s magnificent array,<br>And earth was shaken by the beat<br>And trampling of unnumbered feet.<br>Then to the giants’ ears were borne,<br>The mingled notes of drum and horn,<br>And clash of tambours smote the sky,<br>And shouting and the battle cry.<br>The sound of martial strains inspired<br>Each chieftain, and his bosom fired:<br>While giants from their walls replied,<br>And answering shouts the foe defied,<br>Then Ráma looked on Lanká where<br>Bright banners floated in the air,<br>And, pierced with anguish at the view,<br>His loving thoughts to Sítá flew.<br>“There, prisoned by the giant, lies<br>My lady of the tender eyes,<br>Like Rohiṇí the queen of stars<br>O’erpowered by the fiery Mars.”<br>Then turned he to his brother chief<br>And cried in agony of grief:<br>“See on the hill, divinely planned<br>And built by Viśvakarmá’s hand,<br>The towers and domes of Lanká rise<br>In peerless beauty to the skies.<br>Bright from afar the city shines<br>With gleam of palaces and shrines,<br>Like pale clouds through the region spread<br>By Vishṇu’s self inhabited.<br>Fair gardens grow, and woods between<br>The stately domes are fresh and green,<br>Where trees their bloom and fruit display,<br>And sweet birds sing on every spray.<br>Each bird is mad with joy, and bees<br>Sing labouring in the bloomy trees<br>On branches by the breezes bowed,<br>Where the gay Koïl’s voice is loud.”<br><br>  This said, he ranged with warlike art<br>Each body of the host apart.<br>“There in the centre,” Ráma cried,<br>“Be Angad’s place by Níla’s side.<br>Let Rishabh of impetuous might<br>Be lord and leader on the right,<br>And Gandhamádan, next in rank,<br>Be captain of the farther flank.<br>Lakshmaṇ and I the hosts will lead,<br>And Jámbaván of ursine breed,<br>With bold Susheṇ unused to fear,<br>And Vegadarśí, guide the rear.”<br><br>  Thus Ráma spoke: the chiefs obeyed;<br>And all the Vánar hosts arrayed<br>Showed awful as the autumn sky<br>When clouds embattled form on high.<br>Their arms were mighty trees o’erthrown,<br>And massy blocks of mountain stone.<br>One hope in every warlike breast,<br>One firm resolve, they onward pressed,<br>To die in fight or batter down<br>The walls and towers of Lanká’s town.<br><br>  Those marshalled legions Ráma eyed,<br>And thus to King Sugríva cried:<br>“Now, Monarch, ere the hosts proceed,<br>Let Śuka, Rávaṇ’s spy, be freed.”<br>He spoke: the Vánar gave consent<br>And loosed him from imprisonment:<br>And Śuka, trembling and afraid,<br>His homeward way to Rávaṇ made.<br>Loud laughed the lord of Lanká’s isle:<br>“Where hast thou stayed this weary while?<br>Why is thy plumage marred, and why<br>Do twisted cords thy pinions tie?<br>Say, comest thou in evil plight<br>The victim of the Vánars’ spite?”<br><br>  He ceased: the spy his fear controlled,<br>And to the king his story told:<br>“I reached the ocean’s distant shore,<br>Thy message to the king I bore.<br>In sudden wrath the Vánars rose,<br>They struck me down with furious blows;<br>They seized me helpless on the ground,<br>My plumage rent, my pinions bound.<br>They would not, headlong in their ire,<br>Consider, listen, or inquire;<br>So fickle, wrathful, rough and rude<br>Is the wild forest multitude.<br>There, marshalling the Vánar bands,<br>King Ráma with Sugríva stands,<br>Ráma the matchless warrior, who<br>Virádha and Kabandha slew,<br>Khara, and countless giants more,<br>And tracks his queen to Lanká’s shore.<br>A bridge athwart the sea was cast,<br>And o’er it have his legions passed.<br>Hark! heralded by horns and drums<br>The terrible avenger comes.<br>E’en now the giants’ isle he fills<br>With warriors huge as clouds and hills,<br>And burning with vindictive hate<br>Will thunder soon at Lanká’s gate.<br>Yield or oppose him: choose between<br>Thy safety and the Maithil queen.”<br><br>  He ceased: the tyrant’s eyeballs blazed<br>With fury as his voice he raised:<br>“No, if the dwellers of the sky,<br>Gandharvas, fiends assail me, I<br>Will keep the Maithil lady still,<br>Nor yield her back for fear of ill.<br>When shall my shafts with iron hail<br>My foeman, Raghu’s son, assail,<br>Thick as the bees with eager wing<br>Beat on the flowery trees of spring?<br>O, let me meet my foe at length,<br>And strip him of his vaunted strength,<br>Fierce as the sun who shines afar<br>Stealing the light of every star.<br>Strong as the sea’s impetuous might<br>My ways are like the tempest’s flight;<br>But Ráma knows not this, or he<br>In terror from my face would flee.”
