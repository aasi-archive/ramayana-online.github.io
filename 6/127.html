                            But Ráma, when he first looked down<br>And saw afar Ayodhyá’s town,<br>Had called Hanumán to his side,<br>The chief on whom his heart relied,<br>And said: “Brave Vánar, good at need,<br>Haste onward, to Ayodhyá speed,<br>And learn, I pray, if all be well<br>With those who in the palace dwell.<br>But as thou speedest on thy way<br>Awhile at Śringavera stay.<br>Tell Guha the Nishádas’ lord,<br>That victor, with my queen restored,<br>In health and strength with many a friend<br>Homeward again my steps I bend.<br>Thence by the road that he will show<br>On to Ayodhyá swiftly go.<br>There with my love my brother greet,<br>And all our wondrous tale repeat.<br>Say that victorious in the strife<br>I come with Lakshmaṇ and my wife,<br>Then mark with keenest eye each trace<br>Of joy or grief on Bharat’s face.<br>Be all his gestures closely viewed,<br>Each change of look and attitude.<br>Where breathes the man who will not cling<br>To all that glorifies a king?<br>Where beats the heart that can resign<br>An ancient kingdom, nor repine<br>To lose a land renowned for breeds<br>Of elephants and warrior steeds?<br>If, won by custom day by day,<br>My brother Bharat thirsts for sway,<br>Still let him rule the nations, still<br>The throne of old Ikshváku fill.<br>Go, mark him well: his feelings learn,<br>And, ere we yet be near return.”<br><br>  He ceased: and, garbed in human form,<br>Forth sped Hanúmán swift as storm.<br>Sublime in air he rose, and through<br>The region of his father flew.<br>He saw far far beneath his feet<br>Where Gangá’s flood and Jumna meet.<br>Descending from the upper air<br>He entered Śringavera, where<br>King Guha’s heart was well content<br>To hear the message Ráma sent.<br>Then, with his mighty strength renewed,<br>The Vánar chief his way pursued,<br>Válúkiní was far behind,<br>And Gomatí with forests lined,<br>And golden fields and pastures gay<br>With flocks and herds beneath him lay.<br>Then Nandigráma charmed his eye<br>Where flowers were bright with every dye,<br>And trees of lovely foliage made<br>With meeting boughs delightful shade,<br>Where women watched in trim array<br>Their little sons’ and grandsons’ play.<br>His eager eye on Bharat fell<br>Who sat before his lonely cell.<br>In hermit weed, with tangled hair,<br>Pale, weak, and worn with ceaseless care.<br>His royal pomp and state resigned<br>For Ráma still he watched and pined,<br>Still to his dreary vows adhered,<br>And royal Ráma’s shoes revered.<br>Yet still the terror of his arm<br>Preserved the land from fear and harm.<br><br>  The Wind-God’s son, in form a man,<br>Raised reverent hands and thus began:<br>“Fond greeting, Prince, I bring to thee,<br>And Ráma’s self has sent it: he<br>For whom thy spirit sorrows yet<br>As for a hapless anchoret<br>In Daṇḍak wood, in dire distress,<br>With matted hair and hermit dress.<br>This sorrow from thy bosom fling,<br>And hear the tale of joy I bring.<br>This day thy brother shalt thou meet<br>Exulting in his foe’s defeat,<br>Freed from his toil and lengthened vow,<br>The light of victory on his brow,<br>With Sítá, Lakshmaṇ and his friends<br>Homeward at last his steps he bends.”<br><br>  Then joy, too mighty for control,<br>Rushed in full flood o’er Bharat’s soul;<br>His reeling sense and strength gave way,<br>And fainting on the earth he lay,<br>At length upspringing from the ground,<br>His arms about Hanúmán wound,<br>With tender tears of rapture sprung,<br>He dewed the neck to which he clung:<br>“Art thou a God or man,” he cried,<br>“Whom love and pity hither guide?<br>For this a hundred thousand kine,<br>A hundred villages be thine.<br>A score of maids of spotless lives<br>To thee I give to be thy wives,<br>Of golden hue and bright of face,<br>Each lovely for her tender grace.”<br><br>  He ceased a while by joy subdued,<br>And then his eager speech renewed.
