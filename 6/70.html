                            Then raged the Rákshas chiefs, and all<br>Burned to avenge Narántak’s fall.<br>Devántak raised his club on high<br>And rushed at Angad with a cry.<br>Behind came Triśirás, and near<br>Mahodar charged with levelled spear.<br>There Angad stood to fight with three:<br>High o’er his head he waved a tree,<br>And at Devántak, swift and true<br>As Indra’s flaming bolt, it flew.<br>But, cut by giant shafts in twain,<br>With minished force it flew in vain.<br>A shower of trees and blocks of stone<br>From Angad’s hand was fiercely thrown;<br>But well his club Devántak plied<br>And turned each rock and tree aside.<br>Nor yet, by three such foes assailed,<br>The heart of Angad sank or quailed.<br>He slew the mighty beast that bore<br>Mahodar: from his head he tore<br>A bleeding tusk, and blow on blow<br>Fell fiercely on his Rákshas foe.<br>The giant reeled, but strength regained,<br>And furious strokes on Angad rained,<br>Who, wounded by the storm of blows,<br>Sank on his knees, but swiftly rose.<br>Then Triśirás, as up he sprang,<br>Drew his great bow with awful clang,<br>And fixed three arrows from his sheaf<br>Full in the forehead of the chief.<br>Hanúmán saw, nor long delayed<br>To speed with Níla to his aid,<br>Who at the three-faced giant sent<br>A peak from Lanká’s mountain rent.<br>But Triśirás with certain aim<br>Shot rapid arrows as it came:<br>And shivered by their force it broke<br>And fell to earth with flash and smoke.<br>Then as the Wind-God’s son came nigh,<br>Devántak reared his mace on high.<br>Hanúmán smote him on the head<br>And stretched the monstrous giant dead.<br>Fierce Triśirás with fury strained<br>His bow, and showers of arrows rained<br>That smote on Níla’s side and chest:<br>He sank a moment, sore distressed;<br>But quickly gathered strength to seize<br>A mountain with its crown of trees.<br>Crushed by the hill, distained with gore,<br>Mahodar fell to rise no more.<br><br>  Then Triśirás raised high his spear<br>Which chilled the trembling foe with fear<br>And, like a flashing meteor through<br>The air at Hanúmán it flew.<br>The Vánar shunned the threatened stroke,<br>And with strong hands the weapon broke.<br>The giant drew his glittering blade:<br>Dire was the wound the weapon made<br>Deep in the Vánar’s ample chest,<br>Who, for a moment sore oppressed,<br>Raised his broad hand, regaining might,<br>And struck the rover of the night.<br>Fierce was the blow: with one wild yell<br>Low on the earth the monster fell.<br>Hanúmán seized his fallen sword<br>Which served no more its senseless lord,<br>And from the monster triple-necked<br>Smote his huge heads with crowns bedecked.<br>Then Mahápárśva burned with ire;<br>Fierce flashed his eyes with vengeful fire.<br>A moment on the dead he gazed,<br>Then his black mace aloft was raised,<br>And down the mass of iron came<br>That struck and shook the Vánar’s frame.<br>Hanúmán’s chest was wellnigh crushed,<br>And from his mouth red torrents gushed:<br>Yet served one instant to restore<br>His spirit: from the foe he tore<br>His awful mace, and smote, and laid<br>The giant in the dust dismayed.<br>Crushed were his jaws and teeth and eyes:<br>Breathless and still he lay as lies<br>A summit from a mountain rent<br>By him who rules the firmament.
