                            But Atikáya’s wrath grew high<br>To see his noblest kinsmen die.<br>He, fiercest of the giant race,<br>Presuming still on Brahmá’s grace;<br>Proud tamer of the Immortals’ pride,<br>Whose power and might with Indra’s vied,<br>For blood and vengeful carnage burned,<br>And on the foe his fury turned.<br>High on a car that flashed and glowed<br>Bright as a thousand suns he rode.<br>Around his princely brows was set<br>A rich bejewelled coronet.<br>Gold pendants in his ears he wore;<br>He strained and tried the bow he bore,<br>And ever, as a shaft he aimed,<br>His name and royal race proclaimed.<br>Scarce might the Vánars brook to hear<br>His clanging bow and voice of fear:<br>To Raghu’s elder son they fled,<br>Their sure defence in woe and dread.<br>Then Ráma bent his eyes afar<br>And saw the giant in his car<br>Fast following the flying crowd<br>And roaring like a rainy cloud.<br>He, with the lust of battle fired,<br>Turned to Vibhishaṇ and inquired:<br>“Say, who is this, of mountain size,<br>This archer with the lion eyes?<br>His car, which strikes our host with awe,<br>A thousand eager coursers draw.<br>Surrounded by the flashing spears<br>Which line his car, the chief appears<br>Like some huge cloud when lightnings play<br>About it on a stormy day;<br>And the great bow he joys to hold<br>Whose bended back is bright with gold,<br>As Indra’s bow makes glad the skies,<br>That best of chariots glorifies.<br>O see the sunlike splendour flung<br>From the great flag above him hung,<br>Where, blazoned with refulgent lines,<br>Ráhu<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The demon of eclipse who seizes the Sun and Moon.

Vibhishaṇ eyed<br>The giants’ chief, and thus replied:<br>“This Ráma, this is Rávaṇ’s son:<br>High fame his youthful might has won.<br>He, best of warriors, bows his ear<br>The wisdom of the wise to hear.<br>Supreme is he mid those who know<br>The mastery of sword and bow.<br>Unrivalled in the bold attack<br>On elephant’s or courser’s back,<br>He knows, beside, each subtler art,<br>To win the foe, to bribe, or part.<br>On him the giant hosts rely,<br>And fear no ill when he is nigh.<br>This peerless chieftain bears the name<br>Of Atikáya huge of frame,<br>Whom Dhanyamáliní of yore<br>To Rávaṇ lord of Lanká bore.”<br><br>  Roused by his bow-string’s awful clang,<br>To meet their foes the Vánars sprang.<br>Armed with tall trees from Lanká’s wood,<br>And rocks and mountain peaks, they stood.<br>The giant’s arrows, gold-bedecked,<br>The storm of hurtling missiles checked;<br>And ever on his foemen poured<br>Fierce tempest from his clanging cord;<br>Nor could the Vánar chiefs sustain<br>His shafts’ intolerable rain.<br>They fled: the victor gained the place<br>Where stood the lord of Raghu’s race,<br>And cried with voice of thunder: “Lo,<br>Borne on my car, with shaft and bow,<br>I, champion of the giants, scorn<br>To fight with weaklings humbly born.<br>Come forth your bravest, if he dare,<br>And fight with one who will not spare.”<br><br>  Forth sprang Sumitrá’s noble child,<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Lakshmaṇ.

</span></span><br>And strained his ready bow, and smiled;<br>And giants trembled as the clang<br>Through heaven and earth reëchoing rang.<br>The giant to his string applied<br>A pointed shaft, and proudly cried;<br>“Turn, turn, Sumitrá’s son and fly,<br>For terrible as Death am I.<br>Fly, nor that youthful form oppose,<br>Untrained in war, to warriors’ blows.<br>What! wilt thou waste thy childish breath<br>And wake the dormant fire of death?<br>Cast down, rash boy, that useless bow:<br>Preserve thy life, uninjured go.”<br><br>  He ceased: and stirred by wrath & pride<br>Sumitrá’s noble son replied:<br>“By warlike deed, not words alone,<br>The valour of the brave is shown.<br>Cease with vain boasts my scorn to move,<br>And with thine arm thy prowess prove.<br>Borne on thy car, with sword and bow,<br>With all thine arms, thy valour show.<br>Fight, and my deadly shafts this day<br>Low in the dust thy head shall lay,<br>And, rushing fast in ceaseless flood,<br>Shall rend thy flesh and drink thy blood.”<br><br>  His giant foe no answer made,<br>But on his string an arrow laid.<br>He raised his arm, the cord he drew,<br>At Lakshmaṇ’s breast the arrow flew.<br>Sumitrá’s son, his foemen’s dread,<br>Shot a fleet shaft with crescent head,<br>Which cleft that arrow pointed well,<br>And harmless to the earth it fell.<br>A shower of shafts from Lakshmaṇ’s bow<br>Fell fast and furious on the foe<br>Who quailed not as the missiles smote<br>With idle force his iron coat.<br>Then came the friendly Wind-God near,<br>And whispered thus in Lakshmaṇ’s ear:<br>“Such shafts as these in vain assail<br>Thy foe’s impenetrable mail.<br>A more tremendous missile try,<br>Or never may the giant die.<br>Employ the mighty spell, and aim<br>The weapon known by Brahmá’s name.”<br>He ceased; Sumitrá’s son obeyed:<br>On his great bow the shaft was laid,<br>And with a roar like thunder, true<br>As Indra’s flashing bolt, it flew.<br>The giant poured his shafts like rain<br>To check its course, but all in vain.<br>With spear and mace and sword he tried<br>To turn the fiery dart aside.<br>Winged with a force which naught could check,<br>It smote the monster in the neck,<br>And, sundered from his shoulders, rolled<br>To earth his head and helm of gold.
