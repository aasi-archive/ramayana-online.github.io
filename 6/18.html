                            Then Ráma’s rising doubt was stilled,<br>And friendly thoughts his bosom filled.<br>Thus, deep in Scripture’s lore, he spake:<br>“The suppliant will I ne’er forsake,<br>Nor my protecting aid refuse<br>When one in name of friendship sues.<br>Though faults and folly blot his fame,<br>Pity and help he still may claim.”<br><br>  He ceased: Sugríva bowed his head<br>And pondered for a while, and said:<br><br>  “Past number be his faults or few,<br>What think ye of the Rákshas who,<br>When threatening clouds of danger rise,<br>Deserts his brother’s side and flies?<br>Say, Vánars, who may hope to find<br>True friendship in his faithless kind?”<br><br>  The son of Raghu heard his speech:<br>He cast a hasty look on each<br>Of those brave Vánar chiefs, and while<br>Upon his lips there played a smile,<br>To Lakshmaṇ turned and thus expressed<br>The thoughts that moved his gallant breast:<br>“Well versed in Scripture’s lore, and sage<br>And duly reverent to age,<br>Is he, with long experience stored,<br>Who counsels like this Vánar lord.<br>Yet here, methinks, for searching eyes<br>Some deeper, subtler matter lies.<br>To you and all the world are known<br>The perils of a monarch’s throne,<br>While foe and stranger, kith and kin<br>By his misfortune trust to win.<br>By hope of such advantage led,<br>Vibhishaṇ o’er the sea has fled.<br>He in his brother’s stead would reign,<br>And our alliance seeks to gain;<br>And we his offer may embrace,<br>A stranger and of alien race.<br>But if he comes a spy and foe,<br>What power has he to strike a blow<br>In furtherance of his close design?<br>What is his strength compared with mine?<br>And can I, Vánar King, forget<br>The great, the universal debt,<br>Ever to aid and welcome those<br>Who pray for shelter, friends or foes?<br>Hast thou not heard the deathless praise<br>Won by the dove in olden days,<br>Who conquering his fear and hate<br>Welcomed the slayer of his mate,<br>And gave a banquet, to refresh<br>The weary fowler, of his flesh?<br>Now hear me, Vánar King, rehearse<br>What Kaṇdu<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">In Book II, Canto XXI, Kaṇdu is mentioned by Ráma as an example of
filial obedience. At the command of his father he is said to have
killed a cow.

</span></span> spoke in ancient verse,<br>Saint Kaṇva’s son who loved the truth<br>And clave to virtue from his youth:<br>“Strike not the suppliant when he stands<br>And asks thee with beseeching hands<br>For shelter: strike him not although<br>He were thy father’s mortal foe.<br>No, yield him, be he proud or meek,<br>The shelter which he comes to seek,<br>And save thy foeman, if the deed<br>Should cost thy life, in desperate need.”<br>And shall I hear the wretched cry,<br>And my protecting aid deny?<br>Shall I a suppliant’s prayer refuse,<br>And heaven and glory basely lose?<br>No, I will do for honour sake<br>E’en as the holy Kaṇdu spake,<br>Preserve a hero’s name from stain,<br>And bliss in heaven and glory gain.<br>Bound by a solemn vow I sware<br>That all my saving help should share<br>Who sought me in distress and cried,<br>“Thou art my hope, and none beside.”<br>Then go, I pray thee, Vánar King,<br>Vibhishaṇ to my presence bring,<br>Yea, were he Rávaṇ’s self, my vow<br>Forbids me to reject him now.”<br><br>  He ceased: the Vánar king approved;<br>And Ráma toward Vibhishaṇ moved.<br>So moves, a brother God to greet,<br>Lord Indra from his heavenly seat.
