                            Sugríva spake in words like these:<br>“Now, Vánar lords, the occasion seize.<br>For now, of sons and brothers reft,<br>To Rávaṇ little hope is left:<br>And if our host his gates assail<br>His weak defence will surely fail.”<br><br>  At dead of night the Vánar bands<br>Rushed on with torches in their hands.<br>Scared by the coming of the host<br>Each giant warder left his post.<br>Where’er the Vánar legions came<br>Their way was marked with hostile flame<br>That spread in fury to devour<br>Palace and temple, gate and tower.<br>Down came the walls and porches, down<br>Came stately piles that graced the town.<br>In many a house the fire was red,<br>On sandal wood and aloe fed.<br>And scorching flames in billows rolled<br>O’er diamonds and pearls and gold.<br>On cloth of wool, on silk brocade,<br>On linen robes their fury preyed.<br>Wheels, poles and yokes were burned, and all<br>The coursers’ harness in the stall;<br>And elephants’ and chariots’ gear,<br>The sword, the buckler, and the spear.<br>Scared by the crash of falling beams,<br>Mid lamentations, groans and screams,<br>Forth rushed the giants through the flames<br>And with them dragged bewildered dames,<br>Each, with o’erwhelming terror wild,<br>Still clasping to her breast a child.<br>The swift fire from a cloud of smoke<br>Through many a gilded lattice broke,<br>And, melting pearl and coral, rose<br>O’er balconies and porticoes.<br>The startled crane and peacock screamed<br>As with strange light the courtyard gleamed,<br>And fierce unusual glare was thrown<br>On shrinking wood and heated stone.<br>From burning stall and stable freed<br>Rushed frantic elephant and steed,<br>And goaded by the driving blaze<br>Fled wildly through the crowded ways.<br>As earth with fervent heat will glow<br>When comes her final overthrow;<br>From gate to gate, from court to spire<br>Proud Lanká was one blaze of fire,<br>And every headland, rock and bay<br>Shone bright a hundred leagues away.<br>Forth, blinded by the heat and flame<br>Ran countless giants huge of frame;<br>And, mustering for fierce attack,<br>The Vánars charged to drive them back,<br>While shout and scream and roar and cry<br>Reëchoed through the earth and sky.<br>There Ráma stood with strength renewed,<br>And ever, as the foe he viewed,<br>Shaking the distant regions rang<br>His mighty bow’s tremendous clang.<br>Then through the gates Nikumbha hied,<br>And Kumbha by his brother’s side,<br>Sent forth—the bravest and the best—<br>To battle by the king’s behest.<br>There fought the chiefs in open field,<br>And Angad fell and Dwivid reeled.<br>Sugríva saw: by rage impelled<br>He crushed the bow which Kumbha held.<br>About his foe Sugríva wound<br>His arms, and, heaving from the ground<br>The giant hurled him o’er the bank;<br>And deep beneath the sea he sank.<br>Like mandar hill with furious swell<br>Up leapt the waters where he fell.<br>Again he rose: he sprang to land<br>And raised on high his threatening hand:<br>Full on Sugríva’s chest it came<br>And shook the Vánar’s massy frame,<br>But on the wounded bone he broke<br>His wrist—so furious was the stroke.<br>With force that naught could stay or check,<br>Sugríva smote him neath the neck.<br>The fierce blow crashed through flesh and bone<br>And Kumbha lay in death o’erthrown.<br>Nikumbha saw his brother die,<br>And red with fury flashed his eye.<br>He dashed with mighty sway and swing<br>His axe against the Vánar king;<br>But shattered on that living rock<br>It split in fragments at the shock.<br>Sugríva, rising to the blow,<br>Raised his huge hand and smote his foe.<br>And in the dust the giant lay<br>Gasping in blood his soul away.
