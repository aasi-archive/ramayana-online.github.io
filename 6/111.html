                            Vibhishaṇ saw his brother slain,<br>Nor could his heart its woe contain.<br>O’er the dead king he sadly bent<br>And mourned him with a loud lament:<br>“O hero, bold and brave,” he cried,<br>“Skilled in all arms, in battle tried.<br>Spoiled of thy crown, with limbs outspread,<br>Why wilt thou press thy gory bed?<br>Why slumber on the earth’s cold breast,<br>When sumptuous couches woo to rest?<br>Ah me, my brother over bold,<br>Thine is the fate my heart foretold:<br>But love and pride forbade to hear<br>The friend who blamed thy wild career.<br>Fallen is the sun who gave us light,<br>Our lordly moon is veiled in night.<br>Our beacon fire is dead and cold<br>A hundred waves have o’er it rolled.<br>What could his light and fire avail<br>Against Lord Ráma’s arrowy hail?<br>Woe for the giants’ royal tree,<br>Whose stately height was fair to see.<br>His buds were deeds of kingly grace,<br>His bloom the sons who decked his race.<br>With rifled bloom and mangled bough<br>The royal tree lies prostrate now.”<br>“Nay, idly mourn not,” Ráma cried,<br>“The warrior king has nobly died,<br>Intrepid hero, firm through all,<br>So fell he as the brave should fall;<br>And ill beseems it chiefs like us<br>To weep for those who perish thus.<br>Be firm: thy causeless grief restrain,<br>And pay the dues that yet remain.”<br><br>  Again Vibhishaṇ sadly spoke:<br>“His was the hero arm that broke<br>Embattled Gods’ and Indra’s might,<br>Unconquered ere to-day in fight.<br>He rushed against thee, fought and fell,<br>As Ocean, when his waters swell,<br>Hurling his might against a rock,<br>Falls spent and shattered by the shock.<br>Woe for our king’s untimely end,<br>The generous lord the trusty friend:<br>Our sure defence when fear arose,<br>A dreaded scourge to stubborn foes.<br>O, let the king thy hand has slain<br>The honours of the dead obtain.”<br><br>  Then Ráma answered. “Hatred dies<br>When low in dust the foeman lies.<br>Now triumph bids the conflict cease,<br>And knits us in the bonds of peace.<br>Let funeral rites be duly paid.<br>And be it mine thy toil to aid.”
