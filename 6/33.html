                            But Saramá, of gentler mood,<br>With pitying eyes the mourner viewed,<br>Stole to her side and softly told<br>Glad tidings that her heart consoled,<br>Revealing with sweet voice and smile<br>The secret of the giant’s guile.<br>She, one of those who night and day<br>Watching in turns by Sítá lay,<br>Though Rákshas born felt pity’s touch,<br>And loved the hapless lady much.<br><br>  “I heard,” she said, “thy bitter cry,<br>Heard Rávaṇ’s speech and thy reply,<br>For, hiding in the thicket near,<br>No word or tone escaped mine ear.<br>When Rávaṇ hastened forth I bent<br>My steps to follow as he went,<br>And learnt the secret cause that drove<br>The monarch from the Aśoka grove.<br>Believe me, Queen, thou needst not weep<br>For Ráma slaughtered in his sleep.<br>Thy lion lord of men defies<br>By day attack, by night surprise.<br>Can even giants slay with ease<br>Vast hosts who fight with brandished trees,<br>For whom, with eye that never sleeps,<br>His constant watch thy Ráma keeps?<br>Lord of the mighty arm and chest,<br>Of earthly warriors first and best,<br>Whose fame through all the regions rings,<br>Proud scion of a hundred kings;<br>Who guards his life and loves to lend<br>His saving succour to a friend:<br>Whose bow no hand but his can strain,—<br>Thy lord, thy Ráma is not slain.<br>Obedient to his master’s will,<br>A great magician, trained in ill,<br>With deftest art surpassing thought<br>That marvellous illusion wrought.<br>Let rising hope thy grief dispel:<br>Look up and smile, for all is well,<br>And gentle Lakshmí, Fortune’s Queen,<br>Regards thee with a favouring mien.<br>Thy Ráma with his Vánar train<br>Has thrown a bridge athwart the main,<br>Has led his countless legions o’er,<br>And ranged them on this southern shore.<br>These eyes have seen the hero stand<br>Girt by his hosts on Lanká’s strand,<br>And breathless spies each moment bring<br>Fresh tidings to the giant king;<br>And every peer and lord of state<br>Is called to counsel and debate.”<br><br>  She ceased: the sound, long loud and clear,<br>Of gathering armies smote her ear,<br>Where call of drum and shell rang out,<br>The tambour and the battle shout;<br>And, while the din the echoes woke,<br>Again to Janak’s child she spoke:<br>“Hear, lady, hear the loud alarms<br>That call the Rákshas troops to arms,<br>From stable and from stall they lead<br>The elephant and neighing steed,<br>Brace harness on with deftest care,<br>And chariots for the fight prepare.<br>Swift o’er the trembling ground career<br>Mailed horsemen armed with axe and spear,<br>And here and there in road and street<br>The terrible battalions meet.<br>I hear the gathering near and far,<br>The snorting steed, the rattling car.<br>Bold chieftains, leaders of the brave,<br>Press densely on, like wave on wave,<br>And bright the evening sunbeams glance<br>On helm and shield, on sword and lance.<br>Hark, lady, to the ringing steel,<br>Hark to the rolling chariot wheel:<br>Hark to the mettled courser’s neigh<br>And drums’ loud thunder far away.<br>The Queen of Fortune holds thee dear,<br>For Lanká’s troops are struck with fear,<br>And Ráma with the lotus eyes,<br>Like Indra monarch of the skies,<br>With conquering arm will slay his foe<br>And free his lady from her woe.<br>Soon will his breast support thy head,<br>And tears of joy thine eyes will shed.<br>Soon by his mighty arm embraced<br>The long-lost rapture wilt thou taste,<br>And Ráma, meet for highest bliss,<br>Will gain his guerdon in thy kiss.”
