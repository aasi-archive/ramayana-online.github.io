                            Still Rávaṇ’s haughty heart rebelled,<br>The counsel of the wise repelled,<br>And, as his breast with passion burned,<br>His thoughts again to Sítá turned.<br>Thus, to each sign of danger blind,<br>To love and war he still inclined.<br>Then mounted he his car that glowed<br>With gems and golden net, and rode<br>Where, gathered at the monarch’s call,<br>The nobles filled the council hall.<br>A host of warriors bright and gay<br>With coloured robes and rich array,<br>With shield and mace and spear and sword,<br>Followed the chariot of their lord.<br>Mid the loud voice of shells and beat<br>Of drums he raced along the street,<br>And, ere he came, was heard afar<br>The rolling thunder of his car.<br>He reached the doors: the nobles bent<br>Their heads before him reverent:<br>And, welcomed with their loud acclaim,<br>Within the glorious hall he came.<br>He sat upon a royal seat<br>With golden steps beneath his feet,<br>And bade the heralds summon all<br>His captains to the council hall.<br>The heralds heard the words he spake,<br>And sped from house to house to wake<br>The giants where they slept or spent<br>The careless hours in merriment.<br>These heard the summons and obeyed:<br>From chamber, grove, and colonnade,<br>On elephants or cars they rode,<br>Or through the streets impatient strode.<br>As birds on rustling pinions fly<br>Through regions of the darkened sky,<br>Thus cars and mettled coursers through<br>The crowded streets of Lanká flew.<br>The council hall was reached, and then,<br>As lions seek their mountain den,<br>Through massy doors that opened wide,<br>With martial stalk the captains hied.<br>Welcomed with honour as was meet<br>They stooped to press their monarch’s feet,<br>And each a place in order found<br>On stool, on cushion, or the ground.<br>Nor did the sage Vibhishaṇ long<br>Delay to join the noble throng.<br>High on a car that shone like flame<br>With gold and flashing gems he came,<br>Drew near and spoke his name aloud,<br>And reverent to his brother bowed.
