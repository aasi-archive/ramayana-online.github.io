                            Thus Saramá her story told:<br>And Sítá’s spirit was consoled,<br>As when the first fresh rain is shed<br>The parching earth is comforted.<br>Then, filled with zeal for Sítá’s sake,<br>Again in gentle tones she spake,<br>And, skilled in arts that soothe and please,<br>Addressed the queen in words like these:<br>“Thy husband, lady, will I seek,<br>Say the fond words thy lips would speak,<br>And then, unseen of any eye,<br>Back to thy side will swiftly fly.<br>My airy flights are speedier far<br>Than Garuḍa’s and the tempest are.”<br><br>  Then Sítá spake: her former woe<br>Still left her accents faint and low:<br>“I know thy steps, which naught can stay,<br>Can urge through heaven and hell their way.<br>Then if thy love and changeless will<br>Would serve the helpless captive still,<br>Go forth and learn each plot and guile<br>Planned by the lord of Lanká’s isle.<br>With magic art like maddening wine<br>He cheats these weeping eyes of mine,<br>Torments me with his suit, nor spares<br>Reproof or flattery, threats or prayers.<br>These guards surround me night and day;<br>My heart is sad, my senses stray;<br>And helpless in my woe I fear<br>The tyrant Rávaṇ even here.”<br><br>  Then Saramá replied: “I go<br>To learn the purpose of thy foe,<br>Soon by thy side again to stand<br>And tell thee what the king has planned.”<br>She sped, she heard with eager ears<br>The tyrant speak his hopes and fears,<br>Where, gathered at their master’s call,<br>The nobles filled the council hall;<br>Then swiftly, to her promise true,<br>Back to the Aśoka grove she flew.<br>The lady on the grassy ground,<br>Longing for her return, she found;<br>Who with a gentle smile, to greet<br>The envoy, led her to a seat.<br>Through her worn frame a shiver ran<br>As Saramá her tale began:<br>“There stood the royal mother: she<br>Besought her son to set thee free,<br>And to her counsel, tears and prayers,<br>The elder nobles added theirs:<br>“O be the Maithil queen restored<br>With honour to her angry lord,<br>Let Janasthán’s unhappy fight<br>Be witness of the hero’s might.<br>Hanúmán o’er the waters came<br>And looked upon the guarded dame.<br>Let Lanká’s chiefs who fought and fell<br>The prowess of the leader tell.”<br>In vain they sued, in vain she wept,<br>His purpose still unchanged he kept,<br>As clings the miser to his gold,<br>He would not loose thee from his hold.<br>No, never till in death he lies,<br>Will Lanká’s lord release his prize.<br>Soon slain by Ráma’s arrows all<br>The giants with their king will fall,<br>And Ráma to his home will lead<br>His black-eyed queen from bondage freed.”<br><br>  An awful sound that moment rose<br>From Lanká’s fast-approaching foes,<br>Where drum and shell in mingled peal<br>Made earth in terror rock and reel.<br>The hosts within the walls arrayed<br>Stood trembling, in their hearts dismayed;<br>Thought of the tempest soon to burst,<br>And Lanká’s lord, their ruin, cursed.
