                            Thus spoke the Self-existent Sire:<br>Then swiftly from the blazing pyre<br>The circling flames were backward rolled,<br>And, raising in his gentle hold<br>Alive unharmed the Maithil dame,<br>The Lord of Fire embodied came.<br>Fair as the morning was her sheen,<br>And gold and gems adorned the queen.<br>Her form in crimson robes arrayed,<br>Her hair was bound in glossy braid.<br>Her wreath was fresh and sweet of scent,<br>Undimmed was every ornament.<br>Then, standing close to Ráma’a side,<br>The universal witness cried:<br>“From every blot and blemish free<br>Thy faithful queen returns to thee.<br>In word or deed, in look or mind<br>Her heart from thee has ne’er declined.<br>By force the giant bore away<br>From thy lone cot his helpless prey;<br>And in his bowers securely kept<br>She still has longed for thee and wept.<br>With soft temptation, bribe and threat,<br>He bade the dame her love forget:<br>But, nobly faithful to her lord,<br>Her soul the giant’s suit abhorred.<br>Receive, O King, thy queen again,<br>Pure, ever pure from spot and stain.”<br><br>  Still stood the king in thoughtful mood<br>And tears of joy his eyes bedewed.<br>Then to the best of Gods the best<br>Of warrior chiefs his mind expressed:<br><br>  “’Twas meet that mid the thousands here<br>The searching fire my queen should clear;<br>For long within the giant’s bower<br>She dwelt the vassal of his power.<br>For else had many a slanderous tongue<br>Reproaches on mine honour flung,<br>And scorned the king who, love-impelled,<br>His consort from the proof withheld.<br>No doubt had I, but surely knew<br>That Janak’s child was pure and true,<br>That, come what might, in good and ill<br>Her faithful heart was with me still.<br>I knew that Rávaṇ could not wrong<br>My queen whom virtue made so strong.<br>I knew his heart would sink and fail,<br>Nor dare her honour to assail,<br>As Ocean, when he raves and roars,<br>Fears to o’erleap his bounding shores.<br>Now to the worlds her truth is shown,<br>And Sítá is again mine own.<br>Thus proved before unnumbered eyes,<br>On her pure fame no shadow lies.<br>As heroes to their glory cleave,<br>Mine own dear spouse I ne’er will leave.”<br>He ceased: and clasped in fond embrace<br>On his dear breast she hid her face.
