                            The giant leader fiercely rained<br>His arrows and the fight maintained.<br>Each time the clanging cord he drew<br>His certain shaft a Vánar slew.<br>Then, as the creatures he has made<br>Fly to the Lord of Life for aid,<br>To Angad for protection fled<br>The Vánar hosts dispirited.<br>Then raged the battle fiercer yet<br>When Angad and the giant met.<br>A hundred thousand arrows, hot<br>With flames of fire, the giant shot;<br>And every shaft he deftly sent<br>His foeman’s body pierced and rent.<br>From Angad’s limbs ran floods of gore:<br>A stately tree from earth he tore,<br>Which, maddened as his gashes bled,<br>He hurled at his opponent’s head.<br>His bow the dauntless giant drew;<br>To meet the tree swift arrows flew,<br>Checked the huge missile’s onward way,<br>And harmless on the earth it lay.<br>A while the Vánar chieftain gazed,<br>Then from the earth a rock he raised<br>Rent from a thunder-splitten height,<br>And cast it with resistless might.<br>The giant marked, and, mace in hand,<br>Leapt from his chariot to the sand,<br>Ere the rough mass descending broke<br>The seat, the wheel, the pole and yoke.<br><br>  Then Angad seized a shattered hill,<br>Whereon the trees were flowering still,<br>And with full force the jagged peak<br>Fell crashing on the giant’s cheek.<br>He staggered, reeled, and fell: the blood<br>Gushed from the giant in a flood.<br>Reft of his might, each sense astray,<br>A while upon the sand he lay.<br>But strength and wandering sense returned<br>Again his eyes with fury burned,<br>And with his mace upraised on high<br>He wounded Angad on the thigh.<br>Then from his hand his mace he threw,<br>And closer to his foeman drew.<br>Then with their fists they fought, and smote<br>On brow and cheek and chest and throat.<br>Worn out with toil, their limbs bedewed,<br>With blood, the strife they still renewed,<br>Like Mercury and fiery Mars<br>Met in fierce battle mid the stars.<br><br>  A while the deadly fight was stayed:<br>Each armed him with his trusty blade<br>Whose sheath with tinkling bells supplied,<br>And golden net, adorned his side;<br>And grasped his ponderous leather shield<br>To fight till one should fall or yield.<br>Unnumbered wounds they gave and took:<br>Their wearied bodies reeled and shook.<br>At length upon the sand that drank<br>Streams of their blood the warriors sank,<br>But as a serpent rears his head<br>Sore wounded by a peasant’s tread,<br>So Angad, fallen on his knees,<br>Yet gathered strength his sword to seize;<br>And, severed by the glittering blade,<br>The giant’s head on earth was laid.
