                            Still was the cry, “The Vánar foes<br>Around the leaguered city close.”<br>King Rávaṇ from the terrace gazed<br>And saw, with eyes where fury blazed,<br>The Vánar host in serried ranks<br>Press to the moat and line the banks,<br>And, first in splendour and in place,<br>The lion lord of Raghu’s race.<br>And Ráma looked on Lanká where<br>Gay flags were streaming to the air,<br>And, while keen sorrow pierced him through,<br>His loving thoughts to Sítá flew:<br>“There, there in deep affliction lies<br>My darling with the fawn-like eyes.<br>There on the cold bare ground she keeps<br>Sad vigil and for Ráma weeps.”<br>Mad with the thought, “Charge, charge,” he cried.<br>“Let earth with Rákshas blood be dyed.”<br><br>  Responsive to his call rang out<br>A loud, a universal shout,<br>As myriads filled the moat with stone,<br>Trees, rocks, and mountains overthrown,<br>And charging at their leader’s call<br>Pressed forward furious to the wall.<br>Some in their headlong ardour scaled<br>The rampart’s height, the guard assailed,<br>And many a ponderous fragment rent<br>From portal, tower, and battlement.<br>Huge gates adorned with burnished gold<br>Were loosed and lifted from their hold;<br>And post and pillar, with a sound<br>Like thunder, fell upon the ground.<br>At every portal, east and west<br>And north and south, the chieftains pressed<br>Each in his post appointed led<br>His myriads in the forest bred.<br><br>  “Charge, let the gates be opened wide:<br>Charge, charge, my giants,” Rávaṇ cried.<br>They heard his voice, and loud and long<br>Rang the wild clamour of the throng,<br>And shell and drum their notes upsent,<br>And every martial instrument.<br>Forth, at the bidding of their lord<br>From every gate the giants poured,<br>As, when the waters rise and swell,<br>Huge waves preceding waves impel.<br>Again from every Vánar throat<br>A scream of fierce defiance smote<br>The welkin: earth and sea and sky<br>Reëchoed with the awful cry.<br>The roar of elephants, the neigh<br>Of horses eager for the fray.<br>The frequent clash of warriors’ steel,<br>The rattling of the chariot wheel.<br>Fierce was the deadly fight: opposed<br>In terrible array they closed,<br>As when the Gods of heaven enraged<br>With rebel fiends wild battle waged.<br>Axe, spear, and mace were wielded well:<br>At every blow a Vánar fell.<br>But shivered rock and brandished tree<br>Brought many a giant on his knee,<br>To perish in his turn beneath<br>The deadly wounds of nails and teeth.
