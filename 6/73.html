                            But Indrajít the fierce and bold<br>With words like these his sire consoled:<br>“Dismiss, O King, thy grief and dread,<br>And be not thus disquieted.<br>Against this numbing sorrow strive,<br>For Indrajít is yet alive;<br>And none in battle may withstand<br>The fury of his strong right hand.<br>This day, O sire, thine eyes shall see<br>The sons of Raghu slain by me.”<br><br>  He ceased: he bade the king farewell:<br>Clear, mid the roar of drum and shell,<br>The clash of sword and harness rang<br>As to his car the warrior sprang.<br>Close followed by his Rákshas train<br>Through Lanká’s gate he reached the plain.<br>Then down he leapt, and bade a band<br>Of giants by the chariot stand:<br>Then with due rites, as rules require,<br>Did worship to the Lord of Fire.<br>The sacred oil, as texts ordain,<br>With wreaths of scented flowers and grain,<br>Within the flame in order due,<br>That mightiest of the giants threw.<br>There on the ground were spear and blade,<br>And arrowy leaves and fuel laid;<br>An iron ladle deep and wide,<br>And robes with sanguine colours dyed.<br>Beside him stood a sable goat:<br>The giant seized it by the throat,<br>And straight from the consuming flame<br>Auspicious signs of victory came.<br>For swiftly, curling to the right,<br>The fire leapt up with willing light<br>Undimmed by smoky cloud, and, red<br>Like gold, upon the offering fed.<br>They brought him, while the flame yet glowed,<br>The dart by Brahmá’s grace bestowed,<br>And all the arms he wielded well<br>Were charmed with text and holy spell.<br><br>  Then fiercer for the fight he burned,<br>And at the foe his chariot turned,<br>While all his followers lifting high<br>Their maces charged with furious cry.<br>Dire, yet more dire the battle grew,<br>As rocks and trees and arrows flew.<br>The giant shot his shafts like rain,<br>And Vánars fell in myriads slain,<br>Sugríva, Angad, Níla felt<br>The wounds his hurtling arrows dealt.<br>His shafts the blood of Gaya drank;<br>Hanúmán reeled and Mainda sank.<br>Bright as the glances of the sun<br>Came the swift darts they could not shun.<br>Caught in the arrowy nets he wove,<br>In vain the sons of Raghu strove;<br>And Ráma, by the darts oppressed,<br>His brother chieftain thus addressed:<br>“See, first this giant warrior sends<br>Destruction, mid our Vánar friends,<br>And now his arrows thick and fast<br>Their binding net around us cast.<br>To Brahmá’s grace the chieftain owes<br>The matchless power and might he shows;<br>And mortal strength in vain contends<br>With him whom Brahmá’s self befriends.<br>Then let us still with dauntless hearts<br>Endure this storm of pelting darts.<br>Soon must we sink bereaved of sense;<br>And then the victor, hurrying hence,<br>Will seek his father in his hall<br>And tell him of his foemen’s fall.”<br>He ceased: o’erpowered by shaft and spell<br>The sons of Raghu reeled and fell.<br>The Rákshas on their bodies gazed;<br>And, mid the shouts his followers raised,<br>Sped back to Lanká to relate<br>In Rávaṇ’s hall the princes’ fate.
