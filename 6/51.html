                            King Rávaṇ, where he sat within,<br>Heard from his hall the deafening din,<br>And with a spirit ill at ease<br>Addressed his lords in words like these:<br><br>  “That warlike shout, those joyous cries,<br>Loud as the thunder of the skies,<br>Upsent from every Vánar throat,<br>Some new-born confidence denote.<br>Hark, how the sea and trembling shore<br>Re-echo with the Vánars’ roar.<br>Though arrowy chains, securely twined<br>Both Ráma and his brother bind,<br>Still must the fierce triumphant shout<br>Disturb my soul with rising doubt.<br>Swift envoys to the army send,<br>And learn what change these cries portend.”<br><br>  Obedient, at their master’s call,<br>Fleet giants clomb the circling wall.<br>They saw the Vánars formed and led:<br>They saw Sugríva at their head,<br>The brothers from their bonds released:<br>And hope grew faint and fear increased.<br>Their faces pale with doubt and dread,<br>Back to the giant king they sped,<br>And to his startled ear revealed<br>The tidings of the battle field.<br><br>  The flush of rage a while gave place<br>To chilling fear that changed his face:<br><br>  “What?” cried the tyrant, “are my foes<br>Freed from the binding snakes that close<br>With venomed clasp round head and limb,<br>Bright as the sun and fierce like him:<br>The spell a God bestowed of yore,<br>The spell that never failed before?<br>If arts like these be useless, how<br>Shall giant strength avail us now?<br>Go forth, Dhúmráksha, good at need,<br>The bravest of my warriors lead:<br>Force through the foe thy conquering way,<br>And Ráma and the Vánars slay.”<br><br>  Before his king with reverence due<br>Dhúmráksha bowed him, and withdrew.<br>Around him at his summons came<br>Fierce legions led by chiefs of fame.<br>Well armed with sword and spear and mace,<br>They hurried to the gathering place,<br>And rushed to battle, borne at speed<br>By elephant and car and steed.
