                            With angry menace Ráma, best<br>Of Raghu’s sons, the Sea addressed:<br>“With fiery flood of arrowy rain<br>Thy channels will I dry and drain.<br>And I and all the Vánar host<br>Will reach on foot the farther coast.<br>Thou shalt not from destruction save<br>The creatures of the teeming wave,<br>And lapse of time shall ne’er efface<br>The memory of the dire disgrace.”<br><br>  Thus spoke the warrior, and prepared<br>The mortal shaft which never spared,<br>Known mystic weapon, by the name<br>Of Brahmá, red with quenchless flame.<br>Great terror, as he strained the bow,<br>Struck heaven above and earth below.<br>Through echoing skies the thunder pealed,<br>And startled mountains rocked and reeled,<br>The earth was black with sudden night<br>And heaven was blotted from the sight.<br>Then ever and anon the glare<br>Of meteors shot through murky air,<br>And with a wild terrific sound<br>Red lightnings struck the trembling ground.<br>In furious gusts the fierce wind blew:<br>Tall trees it shattered and o’erthrew,<br>And, smiting with a giant’s stroke,<br>Huge masses from the mountain broke.<br>A cry of terror long and shrill<br>Came from each valley, plain, and hill.<br>Each ruined dale, each riven peak<br>Re-echoed with a wail or shriek.<br><br>  While Raghu’s son undaunted gazed,<br>The waters of the deep were raised,<br>And, still uplifted more and more,<br>Leapt in wild flood upon the shore.<br>Still Ráma looked upon the tide<br>And kept his post unterrified.<br>Then from the seething flood upreared<br>Majestic Ocean’s form appeared,<br>As rising from his eastern height<br>Springs through the sky the Lord of Light.<br>Attendant on their monarch came<br>Sea serpents with their eyes aflame.<br>Like lazulite mid burning gold<br>His form was wondrous to behold.<br>Bright with each fairest precious stone<br>A chain about his neck was thrown.<br>Calm shone his lotus eyes beneath<br>The blossoms of his heavenly wreath,<br>And many a pearl and sea-born gem<br>Flashed in the monarch’s diadem.<br>There Gangá, tributary queen,<br>And Sindhu<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Indus.

</span></span> by his lord, were seen,<br>And every stream and brook renowned<br>In ancient story girt him round.<br>Then, as the waters rose and swelled,<br>The king with suppliant hands upheld,<br>His glorious head to Ráma bent<br>And thus addressed him reverent:<br>“Air, ether, fire, earth, water, true<br>To nature’s will, their course pursue;<br>And I, as ancient laws ordain,<br>Unfordable must still remain.<br>Yet, Raghu’s son, my counsel hear:<br>I ne’er for love or hope or fear<br>Will pile my waters in a heap<br>And leave a pathway through the deep.<br>Still shall my care for thee provide<br>An easy passage o’er the tide,<br>And like a city’s paven street<br>Shall be the road beneath thy feet.”<br>He ceased: and Ráma spoke again:<br>“This spell is ne’er invoked in vain.<br>Where shall the magic shaft, to spend<br>The fury of its might, descend?”<br>“Shoot,” Ocean cried, “thine arrow forth<br>With all its fury to the north,<br>Where sacred Drumakulya lies,<br>Whose glory with thy glory vies.<br>There dwells a wild Abhíra<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Cowherds, sprung from a Bráhman and a woman of the medical tribe,

</span></span> who delight in ill,<br>And drink my tributary rill.<br>My soul no longer may endure<br>Their neighbourhood and touch impure.<br>At these, O son of Raghu, aim<br>Thine arrow with the quenchless flame.”<br><br>  Swift from the bow, as Ráma drew<br>His cord, the fiery arrow flew.<br>Earth groaned to feel the wound, and sent<br>A rush of water through the rent;<br>And famed for ever is the well<br>Of Vraṇa<span class="footnote-tooltip text-danger"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Vraṇa_ means wound or rent.

</span></span> where the arrow fell.<br>Then every brook and lake beside<br>Throughout the region Ráma dried.<br>But yet he gave a boon to bless<br>And fertilize the wilderness:<br>No fell disease should taint the air,<br>And sheep and kine should prosper there:<br>Earth should produce each pleasant root,<br>The stately trees should bend with fruit;<br>Oil, milk, and honey should abound,<br>And fragrant herbs should clothe the ground.<br>Then spake the king of brooks and seas<br>To Raghu’s son in words like these:<br>“Now let a wondrous task be done<br>By Nala, Viśvakarmá’s son,<br>Who, born of one of Vánar race,<br>Inherits by his father’s grace<br>A share of his celestial art.<br>Call Nala to perform his part,<br>And he, divinely taught and skilled,<br>A bridge athwart the sea shall build.”<br><br>  He spoke and vanished. Nala, best<br>Of Vánar chiefs, the king addressed:<br>“O’er the deep sea where monsters play<br>A bridge, O Ráma, will I lay;<br>For, sharer of my father’s skill,<br>Mine is the power and mine the will.<br>’Tis vain to try each gentler art<br>To bribe and soothe the thankless heart;<br>In vain on such is mercy spent;<br>It yields to naught but punishment.<br>Through fear alone will Ocean now<br>A passage o’er his waves allow.<br>My mother, ere she bore her son,<br>This boon from Viśvakarmá won:<br>“O Mandarí, thy child shall be<br>In skill and glory next to me.”<br>But why unbidden should I fill<br>Thine ear with praises of my skill?<br>Command the Vánar hosts to lay<br>Foundations for the bridge to-day.”<br><br>  He spoke: and swift at Ráma’s hest<br>Up sprang the Vánars from their rest,<br>The mandate of the king obeyed<br>And sought the forest’s mighty shade.<br>Unrooted trees to earth they threw,<br>And to the sea the timber drew.<br>The stately palm was bowed and bent,<br>Aśokas from the ground were rent,<br>And towering Sáls and light bamboos,<br>And trees with flowers of varied hues,<br>With loveliest creepers wreathed and crowned,<br>Shook, reeled, and fell upon the ground.<br>With mighty engines piles of stone<br>And seated hills were overthrown:<br>Unprisoned waters sprang on high,<br>In rain descending from the sky:<br>And ocean with a roar and swell<br>Heaved wildly when the mountains fell.<br>Then the great bridge of wondrous strength<br>Was built, a hundred leagues in length.<br>Rocks huge as autumn clouds bound fast<br>With cordage from the shore were cast,<br>And fragments of each riven hill,<br>And trees whose flowers adorned them still.<br>Wild was the tumult, loud the din<br>As ponderous rocks went thundering in.<br>Ere set of sun, so toiled each crew,<br>Ten leagues and four the structure grew;<br>The labours of the second day<br>Gave twenty more of ready way,<br>And on the fifth, when sank the sun,<br>The whole stupendous work was done.<br>O’er the broad way the Vánars sped,<br>Nor swayed it with their countless tread.<br>Exultant on the ocean strand<br>Vibhishaṇ stood, and, mace in hand,<br>Longed eager for the onward way,<br>And chafed impatient at delay.<br>Then thus to Ráma trained and tried<br>In battle King Sugríva cried:<br>“Come, Hanumán’s broad back ascend;<br>Let Angad help to Lakshmaṇ lend.<br>These high above the sea shall bear<br>Their burthen through the ways of air.”<br><br>  So, with Sugríva, borne o’erhead<br>Ikshváku’s sons the legions led.<br>Behind, the Vánar hosts pursued<br>Their march in endless multitude.<br>Some skimmed the surface of the wave,<br>To some the air a passage gave.<br>Amid their ceaseless roar the sound<br>Of Ocean’s fearful voice was drowned,<br>As o’er the bridge by Nala planned<br>They hastened on to Lanká’s strand,<br>Where, by the pleasant brooks, mid trees<br>Loaded with fruit, they took their ease.
