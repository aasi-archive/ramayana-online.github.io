                            The tyrant’s troubled eye confessed<br>The secret fear that filled his breast.<br>With dread of coming woe dismayed<br>He called his counsellors to aid;<br>Then sternly silent, deep in thought,<br>His chamber in the palace sought.<br>Then, as the surest hope of all,<br>The monarch bade his servants call<br>Vidyujjihva, whom magic skill<br>Made master of the means of ill.<br>Then spake the lord of Lanká’s isle:<br>“Come, Sítá with thine arts beguile.<br>With magic skill and deftest care<br>A head like Ráma’s own prepare.<br>This head, long shafts and mighty bow,<br>To Janak’s daughter will we show.”<br><br>  He ceased: Vidyujjihva obeyed,<br>And wondrous magic skill displayed;<br>And Rávaṇ for the art he showed<br>An ornament of price bestowed.<br>Then to the grove where Sítá lay<br>The lord of Lanká took his way.<br>Pale, wasted, weeping, on the ground<br>The melancholy queen he found,<br>Whose thoughts in utmost stress of ill<br>Were fixed upon her husband still.<br>The giant king approached the dame,<br>Declared in tones of joy his name;<br>Then heeding naught her wild distress<br>Bespake her, stern and pitiless:<br>“The prince to whom thy fancies cling<br>Though loved and wooed by Lanká’s king,<br>Who slew the noble Khara,—he<br>Is slain by warriors sent by me.<br>Thy living root is hewn away,<br>Thy scornful pride is tamed to-day.<br>Thy lord in battle’s front has died,<br>And Sítá shall be Rávaṇ’s bride.<br>Hence, idle thoughts: thy hope is fled;<br>What wilt thou, Sítá, with the dead?<br>Rise, child of Janak, rise and be<br>The queen of all my queens and me.<br>Incline thine ear, and I will tell,<br>Dear lady, how thy husband fell.<br>He bridged his way across the sea<br>With countless troops to fight with me.<br>The setting sun had flushed the west<br>When on the shore they took their rest.<br>Weary with toil no watch they kept,<br>Securely on the sands they slept.<br>Prahasta’s troops assailed our foes,<br>And smote them in their deep repose.<br>Scarce could their bravest prove their might:<br>They perished in the dark of night.<br>Axe, spear, and sword, directed well,<br>Upon the sleeping myriads fell.<br>First in the fight Prahasta’s sword<br>Reft of his head thy slumbering lord.<br>Roused at the din Vibhishaṇ rose,<br>The captive of surrounding foes,<br>And Lakshmaṇ through the woods that spread<br>Around him with his Vánars fled.<br>Hanúmán fell: one deadly stroke<br>The neck of King Sugríva broke,<br>And Mainda sank, and Dwivid lay<br>Gasping in blood his life away.<br>The Vánars died, or fled dispersed<br>Like cloudlets when the storm has burst.<br>Some rose aloft in air, and more<br>Ran to the sea and filled the shore.<br>On shore, in woods, on hill and plain<br>Our conquering giants left the slain.<br>Thus my victorious host o’erthrew<br>The Vánars, and thy husband slew:<br>See, rudely stained with dust, and red<br>With dropping blood, the severed head.”<br><br>  Then, turning to a Rákshas slave,<br>The ruthless king his mandate gave,<br>And straight Vidyujjihva who bore<br>The head still wet with dripping gore,<br>The arrows and the mighty bow,<br>Bent down before his master low.<br>“Vidyujjihva,” cried Rávaṇ, “place<br>The head before the lady’s face,<br>And let her see with weeping eyes<br>That low in death her husband lies.”<br><br>  Before the queen the giant laid<br>The beauteous head his art had made.<br>And Rávaṇ cried: “Thine eyes will know<br>These arrows and the mighty bow.<br>With fame of this by Ráma strung<br>The earth and heaven and hell have rung.<br>Prahasta brought it hither when<br>His hand had slain thy prince of men.<br>Now, widowed Queen, thy hopes resign:<br>Forget thy husband and be mine.”
