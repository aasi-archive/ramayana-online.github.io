                            When Ráma and the host he led<br>Across the sea had safely sped,<br>Thus Rávaṇ, moved by wrath and pride,<br>To Śuka and to Sáraṇ cried:<br>“O counsellors, the Vánar host<br>Has passed the sea from coast to coast,<br>And Daśaratha’s son has wrought<br>A wondrous deed surpassing thought.<br>And now in truth I needs must know<br>The strength and number of the foe.<br>Go ye, to Ráma’s host repair<br>And count me all the legions there.<br>Learn well what power each captain leads<br>His name and fame for warlike deeds.<br>Learn by what artist’s wondrous aid<br>That bridge athwart the sea was made;<br>Learn how the Vánar host came o’er<br>And halted on the island shore.<br>Mark Ráma son of Raghu well;<br>His valour, strength, and weapons tell.<br>Watch his advisers one by one,<br>And Lakshmaṇ, Raghu’s younger son.<br>Learn with observant eyes, and bring<br>“Unerring tidings to your king.<br><br>  He ceased: then swift in Vánar guise<br>Forth on their errand sped the spies.<br>They reached the Vánars, and, dismayed,<br>Their never-ending lines surveyd:<br>Nor would they try, in mere despair,<br>To count the countless legions there,<br>That crowded valley, plain and hill,<br>That pressed about each cave and rill.<br>Though sea-like o’er the land were spread<br>The endless hosts which Ráma led,<br>The bridge by thousands yet was lined,<br>And eager myriads pressed behind.<br>But sage Vibhishaṇ’s watchful eyes<br>Had marked the giants in disguise.<br>He gave command the pair to seize,<br>And told the tale in words like these:<br><br>  “O Ráma these, well known erewhile,<br>Are giant sons of Lanká’s isle,<br>Two counsellors of Rávaṇ sent<br>To watch the invading armament.”<br><br>  Vibhishaṇ ceased: at Ráma’s look<br>The Rákshas envoys quailed and shook;<br>Then suppliant hand to hand they pressed<br>And thus Ikshváku’s son addressed:<br>“O Ráma, bear the truth we speak:<br>Our monarch Rávaṇ bade us seek<br>The Vánar legions and survey<br>Their numbers, strength, and vast array.”<br><br>  Then Ráma, friend and hope and guide<br>Of suffering creatures, thus replied:<br><br>  “Now giants, if your eyes have scanned<br>Our armies, numbering every band,<br>Marked lord and chief, and gazed their fill,<br>Return to Rávaṇ when ye will.<br>If aught remain, if aught anew<br>Ye fain would scan with closer view,<br>Vibhishaṇ, ready at your call,<br>Will lead you forth and show you all.<br>Think not of bonds and capture; fear<br>No loss of life, no peril here:<br>For, captive, helpless and unarmed,<br>An envoy never should be harmed.<br>Again to Lanká’s town repair,<br>Speed to the giant monarch there,<br>And be these words to Rávaṇ told,<br>Fierce brother of the Lord of Gold:<br>“Now, tyrant, tremble for thy sin:<br>Call up thy friends, thy kith and kin,<br>And let the power and might be seen<br>Which made thee bold to steal my queen.<br>To-morrow shall thy mournful eye<br>Behold thy bravest warriors die,<br>And Lanká’s city, tower and wall,<br>Struck by my fiery shafts, will fall.<br>Then shall my vengeful blow descend<br>Its rage on thee and thine to spend,<br>Fierce as the fiery bolt that flew<br>From heaven against the Dánav crew,<br>Mid those rebellious demons sent<br>By him who rules the firmament.”<br><br>  Thus spake Ikshváku’s son, and ceased:<br>The giants from their bonds released<br>Lauded the King with glad accord,<br>And hasted homeward to their lord.<br>Before the tyrant side by side<br>Śuka and Sáraṇ stood and cried:<br>“Vibhishaṇ seized us, King, and fain<br>His helpless captives would have slain.<br>But glorious Ráma saw us; he,<br>Great-hearted hero, made us free.<br>There in one spot our eyes beheld<br>Four chiefs on earth unparalleled,<br>Who with the guardian Gods may vie<br>Who rule the regions of the sky.<br>There Ráma stood, the boast and pride<br>Of Raghu’s race, by Lakshmaṇ’s side.<br>There stood the sage Vibhishaṇ, there<br>Sugríva strong beyond compare.<br>These four alone can batter down<br>Gate, rampart, wall, and Lanká’s town.<br>Nay, Ráma matchless in his form,<br>A single foe, thy town would storm:<br>So wondrous are his weapons, he<br>Needs not the succour of the three.<br>Why speak we of the countless train<br>That fills the valley, hill and plain,<br>The millions of the Vánar breed<br>Whom Ráma and Sugríva lead?<br>O King, be wise, contend no more,<br>And Sítá to her lord restore.”
