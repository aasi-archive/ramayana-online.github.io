                            The Vánar chiefs whose piercing eyes<br>Scanned eagerly the earth and skies,<br>Saw the brave brothers wounded sore<br>Transfixed with darts and stained with gore.<br>The monarch of the Vánar race,<br>With wise Vibhishaṇ, reached the place;<br>Angad and Níla came behind,<br>And others of the forest kind,<br>And standing with Hanúmán there<br>Lamented for the fallen pair.<br>Their melancholy eyes they raised;<br>In fruitless search a while they gazed.<br>But magic arts Vibhishaṇ knew;<br>Not hidden from his keener view,<br>Though veiled by magic from the rest,<br>The son of Rávaṇ stood confessed.<br>Fierce Indrajít with savage pride<br>The fallen sons of Raghu eyed,<br>And every giant heart was proud<br>As thus the warrior cried aloud:<br><br>  “Slain by mine arrows Ráma lies,<br>And closed in death are Lakshmaṇ’s eyes.<br>Dead are the mighty princes who<br>Dúshaṇ and Khara smote and slew.<br>The Gods and fiends may toil in vain<br>To free them from the binding chain.<br>The haughty chief, my father’s dread,<br>Who drove him sleepless from his bed,<br>While Lanká, troubled like a brook<br>In rain time, heard his name and shook:<br>He whose fierce hate our lives pursued<br>Lies helpless by my shafts subdued.<br>Now fruitless is each wondrous deed<br>Wrought by the race the forests breed,<br>And fruitless every toil at last<br>Like cloudlets when the rains are past.”<br>Then rose the shout of giants loud<br>As thunder from a bursting cloud,<br>When, deeming Ráma, dead, they raised<br>Their voices and the conqueror praised.<br><br>  Still motionless, as lie the slain,<br>The brothers pressed the bloody plain,<br>No sigh they drew, no breath they heaved,<br>And lay as though of life bereaved.<br>Proud of the deed his art had done,<br>To Lanká’s town went Rávaṇ’s son,<br>Where, as he passed, all fear was stilled,<br>And every heart with triumph filled.<br>Sugríva trembled as he viewed<br>Each fallen prince with blood bedewed,<br>And in his eyes which overflowed<br>With tears the flame of anger glowed.<br>“Calm,” cried Vibhishaṇ, “calm thy fears,<br>And stay the torrent of thy tears.<br>Still must the chance of battle change,<br>And victory still delight to range.<br>Our cause again will she befriend<br>And bring us triumph in the end.<br>This is not death: each prince will break<br>The spell that holds him, and awake;<br>Nor long shall numbing magic bind<br>The mighty arm, the lofty mind.”<br><br>  He ceased: his finger bathed in dew<br>Across Sugríva’s eyes he drew;<br>From dulling mist his vision freed,<br>And spoke these words to suit the need:<br>“No time is this for fear: away<br>With fainting heart and weak delay.<br>Now, e’en the tear which sorrow wrings<br>From loving eyes destruction brings.<br>Up, on to battle at the head<br>Of those brave troops which Ráma led.<br>Or guardian by his side remain<br>Till sense and strength the prince regain.<br>Soon shall the trance-bound pair revive,<br>And from our hearts all sorrow drive.<br>Though prostrate on the earth he lie,<br>Deem not that Ráma’s death is nigh;<br>Deem not that Lakshmí will forget<br>Or leave her darling champion yet.<br>Rest here and be thy heart consoled;<br>Ponder my words, be firm and bold.<br>I, foremost in the battlefield,<br>Will rally all who faint or yield.<br>Their staring eyes betray their fear;<br>They whisper each in other’s ear.<br>They, when they hear my cheering cry<br>And see the friend of Ráma nigh,<br>Will cast their gloom and fears away<br>Like faded wreaths of yesterday.”<br><br>  Thus calmed he King Sugríva’s dread;<br>Then gave new heart to those who fled.<br>Fierce Indrajít, his soul on fire<br>With pride of conquest, sought his sire,<br>Raised reverent hands, and told him all,<br>The battle and the princes’ fall.<br>Rejoicing at his foes’ defeat<br>Upsprang the monarch from his seat,<br>Girt by his giant courtiers: round<br>His warrior son his arms he wound,<br>Close kisses on his head applied,<br>And heard again how Ráma died.
